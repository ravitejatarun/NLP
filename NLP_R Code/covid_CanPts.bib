  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are considered a priority group
               for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
               vaccination given their high risk of contracting severe
               Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, limited data exist
               regarding the efficacy of immunisation in this population. In
               this study, we assess the immunologic response after COVID-19
               vaccination of cancer versus non-cancer population. METHODS:
               PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
               (CENTRAL), and Web of Science databases were searched from 01st
               March 2020 through 12th August 12 2021. Primary end-points were
               anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG)
               seroconversion rates, T-cell response, and documented SARS-CoV-2
               infection after COVID-19 immunisation. Data were extracted
               following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
               and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall effects were
               pooled using random-effects models. RESULTS: This systematic
               review and meta-analysis included 35 original studies. Overall,
               51\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 41-62) and 73\% (95\% CI,
               64-81) of patients with cancer developed anti-S IgG above the
               threshold level after partial and complete immunisation,
               respectively. Patients with haematologic malignancies had a
               significantly lower seroconversion rate than those with solid
               tumours after complete immunisation (65\% vs 94\%; P < 0.0001).
               Compared with non-cancer controls, oncological patients were
               less likely to attain seroconversion after incomplete (risk
               ratio [RR] 0.45 [95\% CI 0.35-0.58]) and complete (RR 0.69 [95\%
               CI 0.56-0.84]) COVID-19 immunisation schemes. Patients with
               cancer had a higher likelihood of having a documented SARS-CoV-2
               infection after partial (RR 3.21; 95\% CI 0.35-29.04) and
               complete (RR 2.04; 95\% CI 0.38-11.10) immunisation.
               CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer have an impaired immune
               response to COVID-19 vaccination compared with controls.
               Strategies that endorse the completion of vaccination schemes
               are warranted. Future studies should aim to evaluate different
               approaches that enhance oncological patients' immune response.",

               (COVID-19) requiring hospitalization in Japan. METHODS: This
               study included 2638 cases enrolled from 227 healthcare
               facilities that participated in the COVID-19 Registry Japan
               (COVIREGI-JP). The inclusion criteria for enrollment of a case
               in COVIREGI-JP are both (1) a positive severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test and (2) inpatient
               treatment at a healthcare facility. RESULTS: The median age of
               hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 56 years (interquartile
               range [IQR], 40-71 years). More than half of cases were male
               (58.9\%, 1542/2619). Nearly 60\% of the cases had close contact
               to confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. The median duration
               of symptoms before admission was 7 days (IQR, 4-10 days). The
               most common comorbidities were hypertension (15\%, 396/2638) and
               diabetes without complications (14.2\%, 374/2638). The number of
               nonsevere cases (68.2\%, n = 1798) was twice the number of
               severe cases (31.8\%, n = 840) at admission. The respiratory
               support during hospitalization includes those who received no
               oxygen support (61.6\%, 1623/2636) followed by those who
               received supplemental oxygen (29.9\%, 788/2636) and invasive
               mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
               (8.5\%, 225/2636). Overall, 66.9\% (1762/2634) of patients were
               discharged home, while 7.5\% (197/2634) died. CONCLUSIONS: We
               identified the clinical epidemiological features of COVID-19 in
               hospitalized patients in Japan. When compared with existing

               COVID-19 pandemic and to protect people who have a higher risk
               of developing severe illness and death from COVID-19 such as

               acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccination of the Salah Azaiez
               Institute (SAI) of cancer of Tunisia patients and to identify
               its associated factors. METHODS: It was a cross sectional study
               about patients admitted to the SAI for treatment during the
               month of February 2021. Univariate and multivariate analyses
               were performed to identify factors associated with the COVID-19
               vaccine acceptance among Tunisian cancer patients. RESULTS: A
               total of 200 patients were included in this study with a mean
               age of 54.4$\pm$12.7 years and a gender ratio of 0.5. Only
               35.0\% of surveyed patients reported their acceptance to receive
               the COVID-19 vaccine. Multivariate analysis showed that
               believing in COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy (OR=3.1
               [1.3-7.4]), enrollment in the COVID-19 vaccine platform (OR=8.3

               (OR=3.9 [1.6-9.3]) were independently associated with the
               COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among SAI cancer patients.
               CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate found in this
               study was low. Communication strategies of the vaccination
               campaigns should provide clear, simple and detailed messages

               this cross-sectional study, from March 15th, 2020 to September
               15th, 2020, medical records of 61 patients (Group 1) diagnosed
               and scheduled for surgery for head and neck cancer in our
               tertiary care center were revised and compared with 64 head and
               neck cancer patients treated in the same institution in the same
               time period of the previous year (Group2). Surgical site, TNM

               symptom occurrence to first admission to our institution, and
               time to surgery were noted. RESULTS: In Group 1, out of 56
               patients, 26 were diagnosed with T1-2 tumor, while 30 had T3-4
               tumor. In Group 2, 43 of 60 patients had T1-2 tumor, while only
               17 of them were diagnosed with T3-4 tumor. The rate of T3-4
               tumors had significantly increased in 2020 when compared to 2019
               (p = 0.049). In oral cavity cancer patients, N stage was
               significantly increased in Group 1 when compared to Group 2 (p =
               0.024). Need for reconstruction with regional or free flaps were
               significantly increased in oral cavity cancer patients (p =
               0,022). The mean time from the beginning of the first symptom to
               the admission was 19.01 $\pm$ 4.6 weeks (ranging between 11 and
               32 weeks) in Group 1, while it was 16.6 $\pm$ 5.9 weeks in Group
               2 (ranging between 6 and18 weeks); with significant increase (p
               = 0,02). The time to surgery from first admission was 3.4 $\pm$
               2.5 and 2.9 $\pm$ 1.2 weeks in Group 1 and 2, respectively, with
               no statistically significant difference (p = 0.06). CONCLUSION:
               The COVID-19 pandemic has caused delay in the diagnosis and
               treatment of many diseases as such in head and neck cancers.
               Admission with advanced stage disease and the need for more
               complex reconstructive procedures were increased. During the
               pandemic, the management of other diseases that cause mortality

               infectious diseases, including COVID-19. In this context, data
               from developing countries remain scarce. Objectives: the
               objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status and
               outcomes of Mexican cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a
               tertiary care center. Methods: this was a retrospective study
               including 121 consecutive cancer patients diagnosed with
               COVID-19 at the National Cancer Institute, Mexico City, during
               four months. Results: the most frequent oncological diagnoses
               were gynecological (19 \%) and hematological (17 \%). Most
               patients were overweight (35 \%). In the univariate analysis,
               $\geq$ 65 years, intubation, hypoalbuminemia, high creatinine,
               lymphopenia, nutrition-impact symptoms, and ECOG 2-4 were
               statistically associated with lower survival. The median
               survival of the cohort was 41 days. Conclusions: to our best
               knowledge, this is the first study of its kind performed in
               Mexico, and as other studies from other regions, our results
               might aid in identifying cancer patients most at risk for severe

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It was shown that immunocompromised patients have
               significantly reduced immunologic responses to COVID-19
               vaccines. The immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine/infection in
               patients with solid tumors is reduced. We evaluated the
               immunologic response to COVID-19 and/or the BNT162b2 mRNA
               COVID-19 vaccine among cancer patients on active treatments and
               reviewed previous literature to identify subgroups that may
               require third vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2
               S1/S2 antibodies were measured in a cohort of 202 cancer
               patients on active treatment with chemotherapy (96), immunologic
               (52), biologic (46), and hormonal (12) treatments for early (n =
               66, 32.7\%) or metastatic disease (n = 136, 67.3\%). Of those,
               172 had received two vaccine doses, and 30 had COVID-19
               infection (20/30 also received one dose of vaccine). Specific
               anti-S receptor-binding domain antibodies were further measured
               in patients with equivocal anti-S1/S2 results. RESULTS: Among
               cancer patients, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response rate was
               89.1\% (180/202) after COVID-19 vaccination or infection and
               87.2\% (150/172) in patients after vaccination without a history
               of COVID-19, compared with 100\% positive serologic tests in a
               control group of 30 health care workers (P 60 AU/ml) was more
               likely with immunotherapy (odds ratio 2.44) and less likely with
               chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both
               COVID-19 vaccine and natural infection are highly immunogenic
               among cancer patients. Our study, however, identifies those
               under chemotherapy as significantly less responsive, and with
               lower antibody levels. These findings justify close virological
               and serological surveillance along with consideration of these
               patients for booster (third dose) vaccine prioritization, as new
               highly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge.",

               METHODS: We evaluated 4973 hospitalized patients $\geq$ 18 years
               of age tested for COVID-19 from March 11 through April 28, 2020,
               at two academic hospitals. The primary exposure was a positive
               COVID-19 test. The primary outcome was detection of a
               gastrointestinal pathogen by PCR stool testing. RESULTS: Among
               4973 hospitalized individuals, 311 were tested for
               gastrointestinal infections (204 COVID-19 positive, 107 COVID-19
               negative). Patients with COVID-19 were less likely to test
               positive compared to patients without COVID-19 (10\% vs 22\%, p
               < 0.01). This trend was driven by lower rates of non-C.difficile
               infections (11\% vs 22\% in COVID-19 positive vs. negative,
               respectively, p = 0.04), but not C. difficile infection (5.1\%
               vs. 8.2\%, p = 0.33). On multivariable analysis, infection with
               COVID-19 remained significantly associated with lower odds of
               concurrent GI infection (aOR 0.49, 95\% CI 0.24-0.97), again
               driven by reduced non-C.difficile infection. Testing for both
               C.difficile and non-C.difficile enteric infection decreased
               dramatically during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens aside
               from C.difficile do not appear to be a significant contributor
               to diarrhea in COVID-19 positive patients.",

  abstract  = "Importance: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been
               theorized to decrease the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
               patients with prostate cancer owing to a potential decrease in
               the tissue-based expression of the SARS-CoV-2 coreceptor
               transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Objective: To
               examine whether ADT is associated with a decreased rate of
               30-day mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with
               prostate cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort
               study analyzed patient data recorded in the COVID-19 and Cancer
               Consortium registry between March 17, 2020, and February 11,
               2021. The consortium maintains a centralized multi-institution
               registry of patients with a current or past diagnosis of cancer
               who developed COVID-19. Data were collected and managed using
               REDCap software hosted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
               in Nashville, Tennessee. Initially, 1228 patients aged 18 years
               or older with prostate cancer listed as their primary malignant
               neoplasm were included; 122 patients with a second malignant
               neoplasm, insufficient follow-up, or low-quality data were
               excluded. Propensity matching was performed using the
               nearest-neighbor method with a 1:3 ratio of treated units to
               control units, adjusted for age, body mass index, race and
               ethnicity, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
               score, smoking status, comorbidities (cardiovascular, pulmonary,
               kidney disease, and diabetes), cancer status, baseline steroid
               use, COVID-19 treatment, and presence of metastatic disease.
               Exposures: Androgen deprivation therapy use was defined as prior
               bilateral orchiectomy or pharmacologic ADT administered within
               the prior 3 months of presentation with COVID-19. Main Outcomes
               and Measures: The primary outcome was the rate of all-cause
               30-day mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis for patients receiving
               ADT compared with patients not receiving ADT after propensity
               matching. Results: After exclusions, 1106 patients with prostate
               cancer (before propensity score matching: median age, 73 years
               [IQR, 65-79 years]; 561 (51\%) self-identified as non-Hispanic
               White) were included for analysis. Of these patients, 477 were
               included for propensity score matching (169 who received ADT and
               308 who did not receive ADT). After propensity matching, there
               was no significant difference in the primary end point of the
               rate of all-cause 30-day mortality (OR, 0.77; 95\% CI,
               0.42-1.42). Conclusions and Relevance: Findings from this cohort
               study suggest that ADT use was not associated with decreased
               mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, large ongoing
               clinical trials will provide further evidence on the role of ADT
               or other androgen-targeted therapies in reducing COVID-19

               vaccination represents a cornerstone in addressing the COVID-19
               pandemic. However, data on COVID-19 vaccination in cancer
               patients are fragmentary and poor. METHODS: An observational
               study was conducted to evaluate the seropositivity rate and
               safety of a two-dose regimen of the BNT162b2 or messenger
               RNA-1273 vaccine in adult patients with solid cancer undergoing
               active anticancer treatment or whose treatment had been
               terminated within 6 months of the start of the study. The
               control group was composed of healthy volunteers. Serum samples
               were evaluated for SARS-COV-2 antibodies before vaccinations and
               2-6 weeks after the administration of the second vaccine dose.
               Primary end-point: seropositivity rate. Secondary end-points:
               safety, factors influencing seroconversion, IgG titers of
               patients versus healthy volunteers, COVID-19 infection. RESULTS:
               Between 20th March 2021 and 12th June 2021, 293 consecutive
               patients with cancer-solid tumours underwent a program of
               COVID-19 vaccinations; of these, 2 patients refused vaccination,
               13 patients did not receive the second dose of the vaccine
               because of cancer progression, and 21 patients had COVID-19
               antibodies at baseline and were excluded. The 257 evaluable
               patients had a median age of 65 years (range 28-86), 66.15\%
               with metastatic disease. Primary end-point: seropositivity rate
               in patients was 75.88\% versus 100\% in the control group.
               Secondary end-points: no Grade 3-4 side-effects, no COVID-19
               infections were reported. Patients median IgG titer was
               significantly lower than in the control group; male sex and
               active anticancer therapy influenced negative seroconversion.

              caused enormous strain on public health. Patients with cancer are
              particularly susceptible to the disease, and their treatment
              plans have been threatened by public health restrictions designed
              to contain the spread. METHODS: This study examined the effects
              of the pandemic on cancer patients' psychology, knowledge,
              attitudes, and practices concerning COVID-19 as well as their
              perceptions of the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer health care
              services. A survey was sent to 5800 patients at a cancer center
              in Toronto, Canada. Descriptive results were summarized.
              Qualitative feedback was coded and summarized. To examine for
              potential associations, regression models were tested for the
              outcomes of patient psychological well-being, knowledge,
              attitudes, and practices, and they accounted for several
              demographic, health literacy, and disease variables. RESULTS: A
              total of 1631 surveys were completed. Most patients saw their
              appointments shifted to virtual visits, and for a substantial
              minority, there was no change. A majority of the patients (62\%)
              expressed fears about contracting the virus. There were no
              independent predictors of COVID-19-related knowledge. Fears were
              more pronounced among patients who did not speak English and
              those who used social media more often. Female participants,
              those who scored higher on knowledge questions, and those who
              used cancer center materials were more likely to take
              preventative measures against infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              provides a snapshot of the state of cancer patient treatment and
              the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of patients between the
              first 2 waves of the pandemic. The study's results can inform our

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The medium-term and long-term impact of COVID-19 in
               patients with cancer is not yet known. In this study, we aimed
               to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae and their impact
               on the survival of patients with cancer. We also aimed to
               describe patterns of resumption and modifications of systemic
               anti-cancer therapy following recovery from SARS-CoV-2
               infection. METHODS: OnCovid is an active European registry study
               enrolling consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with a
               history of solid or haematological malignancy and who had a
               diagnosis of RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this
               retrospective study, patients were enrolled from 35 institutions
               across Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK.
               Patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between
               Feb 27, 2020, and Feb 14, 2021, and entered into the registry at
               the point of data lock (March 1, 2021), were eligible for
               analysis. The present analysis was focused on COVID-19 survivors
               who underwent clinical reassessment at each participating
               institution. We documented prevalence of COVID-19 sequelae and
               described factors associated with their development and their
               association with post-COVID-19 survival, which was defined as
               the interval from post-COVID-19 reassessment to the patients'
               death or last follow-up. We also evaluated resumption of
               systemic anti-cancer therapy in patients treated within 4 weeks
               of COVID-19 diagnosis. The OnCovid study is registered in
               ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04393974. FINDINGS: 2795 patients
               diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between Feb 27, 2020, and
               Feb 14, 2021, were entered into the study by the time of the
               data lock on March 1, 2021. After the exclusion of ineligible
               patients, the final study population consisted of 2634 patients.
               1557 COVID-19 survivors underwent a formal clinical reassessment
               after a median of 22·1 months (IQR 8·4-57·8) from cancer
               diagnosis and 44 days (28-329) from COVID-19 diagnosis. 234
               (15·0\%) patients reported COVID-19 sequelae, including
               respiratory symptoms (116 [49·6\%]) and residual fatigue (96
               [41·0\%]). Sequelae were more common in men (vs women; p=0·041),
               patients aged 65 years or older (vs other age groups; p=0·048),
               patients with two or more comorbidities (vs one or none;
               p=0·0006), and patients with a history of smoking (vs no smoking
               history; p=0·0004). Sequelae were associated with
               hospitalisation for COVID-19 (p<0·0001), complicated COVID-19
               (p<0·0001), and COVID-19 therapy (p=0·0002). With a median
               post-COVID-19 follow-up of 128 days (95\% CI 113-148), COVID-19
               sequelae were associated with an increased risk of death (hazard
               ratio [HR] 1·80 [95\% CI 1·18-2·75]) after adjusting for time to
               post-COVID-19 reassessment, sex, age, comorbidity burden, tumour
               characteristics, anticancer therapy, and COVID-19 severity.
               Among 466 patients on systemic anti-cancer therapy, 70 (15·0\%)
               permanently discontinued therapy, and 178 (38·2\%) resumed
               treatment with a dose or regimen adjustment. Permanent treatment
               discontinuations were independently associated with an increased
               risk of death (HR 3·53 [95\% CI 1·45-8·59]), but dose or regimen
               adjustments were not (0·84 [0·35-2·02]). INTERPRETATION:
               Sequelae post-COVID-19 affect up to 15\% of patients with cancer
               and adversely affect survival and oncological outcomes after
               recovery. Adjustments to systemic anti-cancer therapy can be
               safely pursued in treatment-eligible patients. FUNDING: National

               Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pediatric cancer patients
               is still lacking. The aim of this prospective study was to
               describe clinical management and outcomes of COVID-19 in
               pediatric oncology patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Conducted
               between May 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020, this study included
               76 pediatric oncology patients with confirmed COVID-19.
               Remdesivir (RDV) was the antiviral therapy used. RESULTS: The
               median age of patients was 9 years. Sixty patients were on first
               line treatment. Hematological malignancies constituted 86.8\% of
               patients. Severe to critical infections were 35.4\% of patients.
               The commonest symptom was fever (93.4\%). Chemotherapy was
               delayed in 59.2\% of patients and doses were modified in 30.2\%.
               The 60-day overall survival (OS) stood at 86.8\%, with
               mortalities occurring only among critical patients. Of sixteen
               acute leukemia patients in the first induction therapy, 13
               survived and 10 achieved complete remission. A negative RT-PCR
               within 2 weeks and improvement of radiological findings were
               statistically related to disease severity (P = .008 and .002,
               respectively). Better OS was associated with regression of
               radiological findings after 30 days from infection (P = .002).
               Forty-five patients received RDV, 42.1\% had severe and critical
               forms of infection compared to 25.7\% in the No-RDV group and
               yet OS was comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: Most pediatric
               cancer patients with COVID-19 should have good clinical outcomes
               except for patients with critical infections. Cancer patients
               can tolerate chemotherapy including induction phase, alongside
               COVID-19 treatment. In severe and critical COVID-19, RDV might
               have a potential benefit.",

               objective of this study was to evaluate the risk factors of
               in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients with and without
               cancer and to compare mortality according to gender and
               topography during the year 2020 in Brazil. METHODS: This was a
               secondary data study of hospitalized adult patients with a
               diagnosis of COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction
               testing in Brazil. The data were collected from the Influenza
               Epidemiological Surveillance Information System. RESULTS: This
               study analyzed data from 322,817 patients. The prevalence of
               cancer in patients with COVID-19 was 2.3\%. COVID-19 patients
               with neurological diseases and cancer had the most lethal

               underlying virus-host interactions during cancer therapies
               remain elusive. When comparing nasopharyngeal swabs from cancer
               and noncancer patients for RT-qPCR cycle thresholds measuring
               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 1063
               patients (58\% with cancer), we found that malignant disease
               favors the magnitude and duration of viral RNA shedding
               concomitant with prolonged serum elevations of type 1 IFN that
               anticorrelated with anti-RBD IgG antibodies. Cancer patients
               with a prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection exhibited the typical
               immunopathology of severe COVID-19 at the early phase of
               infection including circulation of immature neutrophils,
               depletion of nonconventional monocytes, and a general
               lymphopenia that, however, was accompanied by a rise in
               plasmablasts, activated follicular T-helper cells, and non-naive
               Granzyme B+FasL+, EomeshighTCF-1high, PD-1+CD8+ Tc1 cells.
               Virus-induced lymphopenia worsened cancer-associated lymphocyte
               loss, and low lymphocyte counts correlated with chronic
               SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, COVID-19 severity, and a higher risk of
               cancer-related death in the first and second surge of the
               pandemic. Lymphocyte loss correlated with significant changes in
               metabolites from the polyamine and biliary salt pathways as well
               as increased blood DNA from Enterobacteriaceae and
               Micrococcaceae gut family members in long-term viral carriers.
               We surmise that cancer therapies may exacerbate the paradoxical
               association between lymphopenia and COVID-19-related
               immunopathology, and that the prevention of COVID-19-induced
               lymphocyte loss may reduce cancer-associated death.",

               including all hospitalized children with cancer conducted
               between mid-April and mid-June 2020 in Ain Shams University
               Hospital, Egypt. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were
               collected. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by reverse
               transcription polymerase chain reaction tests in nasopharyngeal
               swabs. RESULTS: Fifteen of 61 hospitalized children with cancer
               were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. Their mean age was 8.3$\pm$3.5
               years. Initially, 10 (66.7\%) were asymptomatic and 5 (33.3\%)

               risk of dying and developing severe Coronavirus Disease 2019
               (COVID-19). To date, there are few studies including
               co-morbidities and sociodemographic factors when investigating
               the outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of cancer patients. In this
               study, we analyzed cancer patients that have been hospitalized
               due to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in Sweden
               to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mortality and
               morbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected
               data on all patients with cancer that were hospitalized due to
               COVID-19-related symptoms at Uppsala University Hospital and
               Karolinska University Hospital between 1 March and 31 August
               2020. The primary endpoint was COVID-19-related death and the
               secondary endpoint was to describe COVID-19 severity, defined as
               symptom severity (grades 0-4) and length of stay (LOS) at the
               university hospitals. RESULTS: In total, 193 patients were
               included among which 31\% died due to COVID-19 and 8\% died of
               other causes. In a multivariable analysis, older age >70 (OR
               3.6; 95\% CI [1.8-7.3], p < 0.001) and male gender (OR 2.8
               [1.4-5.8], p = 0.005) were factors associated with higher
               likelihood of COVID-19-related death. Several comorbidities
               $\geq$2 (OR 5.4 [2.0-14.3], p = 0.001) was independently
               associated with COVID-19 severity. Treatment with chemotherapy
               within 90 days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis were not associated
               with COVID-19-related death or severity. CONCLUSION: Factors
               associated with higher likelihood of COVID-19-related death were
               older age and male gender. More severe COVID-19 symptoms were
               seen in patients with multiple comorbidities. We did not see any
               associations between COVID-19-related death or severity and
               recent treatment including chemotherapy. In summary, this
               supports a thorough assessment regarding potential risks with
               COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer, with a combination
               of individual risk factors in addition to cancer treatments.",

               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has represented a global
               health threat, especially for cancer patients, that has required
               an urgent reorganization of clinical activities. Here, we will
               critically revise the profound impact that the pandemic has
               generated in lung cancer patients, as well the most significant
               challenges that oncologists have to face to maintain the highest
               possible standards in the management of lung cancer patients in
               the pandemic era. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidences suggested a higher
               susceptibility and mortality of lung cancer patients due to
               COVID-19. The hard management of this patient population has
               been also due to the potential cross interference of anti-tumor
               drugs on SARS-Cov-2 infection and to the differential diagnosis
               between COVID-19 pneumonitis and drug-related pneumonitis.
               COVID-19 pandemic has generated a profound reshaping of
               oncological activities and the development of recommendations by
               the oncology scientific community to prioritize anti-tumor

               disease that is caused by a newly discovered strain of the
               Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS- CoV-2).
               Patients with comorbidities are most vulnerable to this disease.
               Therefore, cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible
               to COVID-19 infection, particularly lung cancer patients. To
               evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive
               susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19
               infection, we targeted the two most crucial agents,
               Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-X-C motif 10
               (CXCL10). ACE2 is a receptor protein that plays a vital role in
               the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell and CXCL10 is a
               cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving
               in a cytokine storm. By using the UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases,
               we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in
               lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma
               (LUSC). We then identified the functional significance of ACE2
               and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic
               alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences using the
               cBioPortal web portal. Lastly, we did the pathological
               assessment of targeted genes using the PANTHER database. Here,
               we found that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly
               co-expressed genes are involved respectively in the binding
               activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and
               COVID-19 infection. Finally, based on this systemic analysis, we
               concluded that ACE2 and CXCL10 are two possible biomarkers
               responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung
               cancer patients towards the COVID-19.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer on active immune checkpoint
               inhibitors therapy were recommended to seek prophylaxis from
               COVID-19 by vaccination. There have been few reports to date to
               discuss the impact of progression cell death-1 blockers (PD-1B)
               on immune or vaccine-related outcomes, and what risk factors
               that contribute to the serological status remains to be
               elucidated. The study aims to find the impact of PD-1B on
               vaccination outcome and investigate other potential risk factors
               associated with the risk of seroconversion failure. METHODS:
               Patients with active cancer treatment were retrospectively
               enrolled to investigate the interaction effects between PD-1B
               and vaccination. Through propensity score matching of
               demographic and clinical features, the seroconversion rates and
               immune/vaccination-related adverse events (irAE and vrAE) were
               compared in a head-to-head manner. Then, a nomogram predicting
               the failure risk was developed with variables significant in
               multivariate regression analysis and validated in an independent
               cohort. RESULTS: Patients (n=454) receiving either PD-1B or
               COVID-19 vaccination, or both, were matched into three cohorts
               (vac+/PD-1B+, vac+/PD-1B-, and vac-/PD-1B+, respectively), with
               a non-concer control group of 206 participants. 68.1\% (94/138),
               71.3\% (117/164), and 80.5\% (166/206) were seropositive in
               vac+/PD-1B+cohort, vac+/PD-1B- cohort, and non-cancer control
               group, respectively. None of irAE or vrAE was observed to be
               escalated in PD-1B treatment except for low-grade rash.The
               vaccinated patients with cancer had a significantly lower rate
               of seroconversion rates than healthy control. A nomogram was
               thus built that encompassed age, pathology, and chemotherapy
               status to predict the seroconversion failure risk, which was
               validated in an independent cancer cohort of 196 patients.
               CONCLUSION: Although patients with cancer had a generally
               decreased rate of seroconversion as compared with the healthy
               population, the COVID-19 vaccine was generally well tolerated,
               and seroconversion was not affected in patients receiving PD-1B.
               A nomogram predicting failure risk was developed, including age,
               chemotherapy status, pathology types, and rheumatic comorbidity.",

               Three hundred and ninety-four respondents volunteered their
               participation in response to a study advertisement distributed
               online through established haematology groups. Participants
               completed a self-report online survey exploring wellbeing,
               psychological distress, unmet supportive care needs, and fear of
               cancer recurrence. RESULTS: At least 1 in 3 respondents (35\%)
               reported clinical levels of distress and nearly 1 in 3 (32\%)
               identified at least one unmet need. Among respondents in
               remission (n = 134), clinical fear of cancer recurrence was
               reported by nearly all (95\%). Unmet needs, pre-existing health
               conditions, younger age, financial concerns, and perceived risk
               of contracting COVID-19 were the dominant factors contributing
               to psychological distress during the pandemic. Psychological
               distress, lost income, perceived inadequate support from care
               team, perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, and being a woman
               were significantly associated with unmet needs. Psychological
               distress and concern about the impact of COVID-19 on cancer
               management were significantly associated with fear of cancer
               recurrence among respondents in remission. CONCLUSION: Results

               Eligible patients received an invitation to receive remote care
               to minimize exposure to an environment in which the risk of
               respiratory infection was present. The means of communication
               was telephone through an application that allows free
               conversation with no charge. An anonymous-response questionnaire
               based on a Likert-type scale was sent through a cell phone
               application or e-mail directly to each patient or close relative
               of the patient immediately after teleconsultation. Responses to
               the questions, which addressed utility, facility, interface
               quality, interaction quality, reliability, satisfaction, and
               interest in future evaluation, were compiled and analyzed.
               RESULTS: A total of 176 eligible patients scheduled for
               consultation were evaluated and 98 were included. Seventy
               (71.4\%) successfully undertook the teleorientation. The
               questionnaire was submitted by 43 (61.4\%) patients. The overall
               teleoncology orientation was classified as very positive by 41
               (95.3\%) patients. Specifically, regarding the questionnaire
               items, 43 (100\%) patients scored 4 or 5 (agreed that the
               teleconsultation was beneficial) concerning the facility,
               followed by 42 (97.2\%) for the interface quality, 41 (95.3\%)

               to gynecologic oncology patients. In addition to directly
               impacting the diagnosis and treatment of women with gynecologic
               cancer, it has affected our patient's ability to undergo
               recommended surveillance and has made an impact on every
               caregiver providing care during this time. Herein we review the

               oncology and highlight new approaches and innovations that have
               resulted in gynecologic cancer care as a result of the pandemic.
               The impact of COVID-19 on the field of gynecologic oncology has
               been profound. In addition to directly impacting the diagnosis
               and treatment of women with cancer, it has also challenged the
               very ethics with which we practice medicine. The equitable
               distribution of resources is paramount to upholding the
               Hippocratic Oath which we all invoke. The COVID-19 pandemic has
               stripped this oath down to its very core, forcing all medical
               practitioners to scrutinize who gets what resources and when. As
               the pandemic continues to unfold, the question remains - in the
               setting of a strained and overburdened healthcare system, how do
               we maximize beneficence to one group of patients, while
               maintaining non-maleficence to others? As gynecologic
               oncologists, we are responsible for advocating for our patients
               to ensure that the quality of their cancer care is not
               compromised, while also not overutilizing resources that are
               sorely needed for the care of COVID-19 victims, and not making
               them more likely to succumb to COVID-19 by the very nature of
               the treatment we provide. The effects of the pandemic are
               far-reaching and broad, and many of these are yet to be
               determined. Future studies are needed to analyze how the
               above-utilized strategies in GYN cancer care during the pandemic

               implemented in clinical practice to limit patient exposure to
               COVID-19 while monitoring their treatment and follow-up. We
               sought to examine the satisfaction of patients with breast
               cancer (BC) who underwent teleconsultations during this period.
               METHODS: Eighteen centres in France and Italy invited patients
               with BC who had at least one teleconsultation during the first
               wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to participate in a web-based
               survey that evaluated their satisfaction (EORTC OUT-PATSAT 35
               and Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire [TSQ] scores) with
               teleconsultation. RESULTS: Among the 1299 participants eligible
               for this analysis, 53\% of participants were undergoing standard
               post-treatment follow-up while 22 and 17\% were currently
               receiving active anticancer therapy for metastatic and localised
               cancers, respectively. The mean satisfaction scores were 77.4
               and 73.3 for the EORTC OUT-PATSAT 35 and TSQ scores,
               respectively. In all, 52.6\% of participants had low/no anxiety.
               Multivariable analysis showed that the EORTC OUT-PATSAT 35 score
               correlated to age, anxiety score and teleconsultation modality.
               The TSQ score correlated to disease status and anxiety score.
               CONCLUSION: Patients with BC were satisfied with oncology
               teleconsultations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teleconsultation
               may be an acceptable alternative follow-up modality in specific
               circumstances.",

               (COVID-19) poses a major public health challenge, and an
               effective vaccine is the potential mechanism to resolve this
               specific situation. The present study aimed to evaluate
               acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among patients attending the
               Oncology Clinic of University Clinical Hospital Mostar. MATERIAL
               AND METHODS This cross-sectional observational study enrolled
               364 patients with cancer from the Oncology Clinic of University
               Clinical Hospital Mostar during February 2021. Data were
               collected using a questionnaire that captured general
               information about the participants and their attitudes toward
               COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS Of the participants, 41.8\%
               answered ``Yes'' when asked if they would take the vaccine once
               it becomes available, 37.6\% answered ``Not sure'', and 20.6\%
               answered ``No''. For patients in favor of vaccination, the main
               reasons reported were fear of getting sick (77.6\%), the desire
               to contribute to herd immunity (57.8\%), and trusting the
               recommendations of health professionals (57.2\%). The main
               reasons for the patients' vaccination -refusal/indecision were
               doubts about the results from clinical trials of COVID-19
               vaccines (49.1\%), concerns about adverse effects (24.5\%), and
               confusion about the various vaccine options (19.8\%). The
               majority of participants (82.4\%) stated that recommendation by
               their oncologist could influence their decision about
               vaccination. Of the participants who indicated unwillingness
               (refusal or indecision) to be vaccinated against COVID-19,
               65.3\% stated that recommendation by their oncologist could
               influence their decision about vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The
               findings from the present study showed most patients had refused
               or were indecisive regarding immunization with COVID-19 vaccine.

               Health, Oman. Data of inpatient coronavirus cases were retrieved
               from the electronic medical records system of the Royal
               Hospital, Muscat, all tertiary hospitals linked electronically
               to the registry and the coronavirus registry of Oman. The data
               of cancer patients infected with coronavirus was analysed and
               compared with non-cancer coronavirus-infected patients. Data was
               analysed using IBM SPSS 2019 v26. RESULTS: Of the 16,260 cancer
               patients, 77(0.47\%) were infected with COVID-19 compared to
               111,837(2.17\%) in the national population. Mortality among

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The results of studies on the relationship between
               cancer and COVID-19 have been conflicting and therefore further
               studies are needed. We aimed to examine the incidence of
               COVID-19 among patients at one of the largest oncology
               departments in Sweden, and to evaluate and identify risk factors
               for poor outcomes, hospital care and death, associated with
               COVID-19 among cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This
               retrospective study included cancer patients at a single center
               who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR either in hospital,
               primary health care center or commercial laboratory between 1
               March and 14 August 2020. Clinical and demographic data were
               collected from the medical records. Logistic regression analysis
               was used to identify variables that associated the primary
               outcomes of need for hospital care and death within 30 days of
               positive test. RESULTS: Of 10,774 patients from the Department
               of Oncology at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, 135 tested
               positive for SARS-CoV-2 (1.3\%). Twenty-eight patients were
               excluded from further the data collection since they did not
               meet the inclusion criteria. Altogether, 107 cancer patients
               were included and the case fatality rate (CFR) was 12\% (13)
               within 30 days of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR.
               Increasing years of age (OR 1.10; CI 95\% 1.03-1.18), palliative
               treatment intent (OR 15.7; CI 95\% 1.8-135.8), and transition to
               end-of-life care (OR 52.0; CI 95\% 3.7-735.6) were associated
               with increased odds of death within 30 days. Male sex was
               associated with needing hospital care (OR 3.7; CI 95\%
               1.50-9.1). CONCLUSION: As in the general population, male sex
               was found to be at greater risk of needing hospital care for
               COVID-19, with terminal cancer disease, and older age increasing
               the odds of fatality. Compared to the general population,
               slightly more cancer patients had COVID-19. The CFR was within
               the lower range of others reported in cancer patients.",

               Patients and methods: In total, 111 adult patients with cancer
               from a single institution were asked to complete a questionnaire
               designed to assess their knowledge about the vaccine, their

               Television, radio and newspapers were the major sources of
               information about the vaccine. A total of 55\% of the patients
               were ready to be vaccinated and 14.4\% refused the vaccine. The

               infection and optimise use of health system resources, while
               maximising patient outcomes, the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted
               unprecedented changes in cancer care. Some new or modified

               long term value in improving the quality and resilience of
               cancer care in Australia and internationally. The Cancer

               the delivery of cancer care during the pandemic and in a
               post-pandemic environment. This article summarises the full

               https://www.canceraustralia.gov.au/covid-19/covid-19-recovery-implications-cancer-care.
               MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: The statement is informed by a desktop
               literature review and input from cancer experts and consumers at
               a virtual roundtable, held in July 2020, on key elements of
               cancer care that changed during the pandemic. It describes
               targeted strategies (at system, service, practitioner and
               patient levels) to retain, enhance and embed high value changes
               in practice. Principal strategies include: implementing
               innovative models of care that are digitally enabled and
               underpinned by clear governance, policies and procedures to
               guide best practice cancer care; enabling health professionals
               to deliver evidence-based best practice and coordinated,
               person-centred cancer care; and empowering patients to improve
               health literacy and enhancing their ability to engage in
               informed, shared decision making. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A
               RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: Widespread adoption of high value
               health care practices across all levels of the cancer control

               pandemic scenario. Specially, cancers like small cell lung
               cancers (SCLC) are difficult to treat even in the normal
               situation due to their rapid growth and early metastasis. For
               such patients, treatment can't be compromised and care must be
               taken to ensure their minimum exposure to the ongoing spread of
               COVID-19 infection. For this reason, in-house treatments are
               being suggested for these patients. Another issue is that
               symptoms of SCLC match well with that of COVID-19 infection.
               Hence, the detection of COVID-19 may also get delayed leading to
               unnecessary complications. Thus, we have tried to investigate if
               the therapeutics that is currently used in lung cancer treatment
               can also act against SARS-CoV-2. If it is so, the same treatment
               protocols can be continued even if the SCLC patient had
               contracted COVID-19 without compromising the cancer care. For
               this, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) from SARS-CoV-2 has
               been selected as drug target. Both docking and molecular
               dynamicssimulation analysis have indicated that Paclitaxel and
               Dacomitinib may be explored as multi-target drugs for both SCLC
               and COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

               COVID-19. At the same time, 920 non-cancer patients were
               recruited from a random sample of individuals who were subject
               to routine molecular and anti-body screening tests. Of 150
               cancer patients, 7 (4.7\%) were RT-PCR positive. Comorbidity

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
               abruptly disrupted cancer care. The impact of these disruptions
               on patient experiences remain relatively understudied. The
               objective of this study was to assess patients' perspectives
               regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their experiences, including
               their cancer care, emotional and mental health, and social
               determinants of health, and to evaluate whether these outcomes
               differed by cancer stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a
               survey among adults with cancer across the United States from
               April 1, 2020 to August 26, 2020 using virtual snowball sampling
               strategy in collaboration with professional organizations,
               cancer care providers, and patient advocacy groups. We analyzed
               data using descriptive statistics, $\chi$2 and t tests. RESULTS:
               Three hundred twelve people with cancer participated and
               represented 38 states. The majority were non-Hispanic White
               (n=183; 58.7\%) and female (n=177; 56.7\%) with median age of 57
               years. Ninety-one percent spoke English at home, 70.1\% had
               health insurance, and 67\% had access to home internet. Breast
               cancer was the most common diagnosis (n=67; 21.5\%). Most had
               Stage 4 disease (n=80; 25.6\%). Forty-six percent (n=145)
               experienced a change in their care due to COVID-19. Sixty
               percent (n=187) reported feeling very or extremely concerned
               that the pandemic would affect their cancer and
               disproportionately experienced among those with advanced cancer
               stages compared with earlier stages (P<0.001). Fifty-two percent
               (n=162) reported impact of COVID-19 on 1 or more aspects of
               social determinants of health with disproportionate impact among
               those with advanced cancer stages compared with earlier stages.
               CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 impacted the care and well-being of
               patients with cancer and this impact was more pronounced among
               people with advanced cancer stages. Future work should consider

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Efficacy and safety data of COVID-19 vaccines among
               cancer populations have been limited; however, preliminary data
               from recent studies have emerged regarding their immunogenicity
               and safety in this population. In this review, we examined
               current peer-reviewed publications containing serological and
               safety data after COVID-19 vaccination of patients with cancer.
               METHODS: This analysis examined 21 studies with a total of 5012
               patients with cancer, of which 2676 (53\%) had haematological
               malignancies, 2309 (46\%) had solid cancers and 739 were healthy
               controls. Serological responses by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
               S1/S2 immunoglobulin G antibody levels and post-vaccination
               patient questionnaires regarding vaccine-related side-effects
               after the first and second dose were collected and analysed.
               RESULTS: In general, a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine
               yields weaker and heterogeneous serological responses in both
               patients with haematological and solid malignancies. On
               receiving a second dose, serological response rates indicate a
               substantial increase in seropositivity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike
               protein in all cancer cohorts, but antibody titres remain
               reduced in comparison with healthy controls. Furthermore,
               seroconversion in patients with haematological malignancies was
               significantly lower than that in patients with solid tumours.
               COVID-19 vaccines are safe and well-tolerated in patients with
               cancer based on current data of local and systemic effects.
               CONCLUSION: Together, these data support the prioritisation of
               patients with cancer to receive their first and second doses to
               minimise the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe complications
               in this vulnerable population. Additional prophylactic measures
               must be considered for high-risk patients where current
               vaccination programs may not mount sufficient protection against
               SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

               of head and neck cancer for patients presenting to the clinics
               of 4 head and neck oncology surgeons with newly diagnosed head
               and neck cancers were compared between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19

               period and 26 patients in the COVID-19 period presented with
               newly diagnosed head and neck cancer. Patients in the COVID-19

               in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups had no statistically
               significant differences in time to staging (P > .9; HR, 1.01;

               diagnosis for head and neck cancers was delayed during a
               COVID-19 period compared to a pre-COVID-19 period. However,
               there was no evidence of delays in time to staging and time to
               treatment during the COVID-19 period. Our results prompt further
               investigations into the factors contributing to diagnostic
               delays but provide reassurance that despite COVID-19, patients

  abstract  = "Objective: This study explored the consistency and differences
               in the immune cells and cytokines between patients with COVID-19
               or cancer. We further analyzed the correlations between the
               acute inflammation and cancer-related immune disorder. Methods:
               This retrospective study involved 167 COVID-19 patients and 218
               cancer patients. COVID-19 and cancer were each further divided
               into two subgroups. Quantitative and qualitative variables were
               measured by one-way ANOVA and chi-square test, respectively.
               Herein, we carried out a correlation analysis between immune
               cells and cytokines and used receiver operating characteristic
               (ROC) curves to discover the optimal diagnostic index. Results:
               COVID-19 and cancers were associated with lymphopenia and high
               levels of monocytes, neutrophils, IL-6, and IL-10. IL-2 was the
               optimal indicator to differentiate the two diseases. Compared
               with respiratory cancer patients, COVID-19 patients had lower
               levels of IL-2 and higher levels of CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B
               cells. In the subgroup analysis, IL-6 was the optimal
               differential diagnostic parameter that had the ability to
               identify if COVID-19 patients would be severely affected, and
               severe COVID-19 patients had lower levels of lymphocyte subsets
               (CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ T cells, CD3+CD8+T cells, and CD19+ B
               cells) and CD16+CD56+ NK cells and higher level of neutrophils.
               There were significant differences in the levels of CD3+CD4+ T
               cells and CD19+ B cells between T1-2 and T3-4 stages as well as
               IL-2 and CD19+ B cells between N0-1 and N2-3 stages while no
               significant differences between the metastatic and nonmetastatic
               cancer patients. Additionally, there were higher correlations
               between IL-2 and IL-4, TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-2, TNF-$\alpha$ and
               IL-4, TNF-$\alpha$ and IFN-$\gamma$, and CD16+CD56+NK cells and
               various subsets of T cells in COVID-19 patients. There was a
               higher correlation between CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells in
               cancer patients. Conclusion: Inflammation associated with
               COVID-19 or cancer had effects on patients' outcomes.
               Accompanied by changes in immune cells and cytokines, there were

               pandemic affecting millions of people around the world. Risk
               factors for critical disease in adults are advanced age and
               underlying medical comorbidities, including cancer. Data are
               sparse on the effect of COVID-19 infection on pediatric patients
               with cancer during their active antineoplastic therapy. The
               optimal management of antineoplastic treatment during COVID-19
               infection in this unique population is controversial. AIM: To
               describe the severity and clinical course of COVID-19 infection
               in pediatric patients with cancer during active antineoplastic
               treatment and to study their course of treatment. METHODS:
               Clinical and laboratory data were collected from medical files
               of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, confirmed by polymerase
               chain reaction (PCR), who received active antineoplastic
               treatment between March 2020 and May 2021 in a large tertiary
               pediatric medical center. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with
               diverse pediatric cancers are described. They were infected with
               COVID-19 at different stages of their antineoplastic treatment
               regimen. Eight had an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection, nine had
               mild symptoms, and one had severe disease. All of them recovered
               from COVID-19 infection. Two patients experienced delays in
               their antineoplastic treatment; none of the other patients had
               delays or interruptions, including patients who were symptomatic
               for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In pediatric patients with cancer who
               test positive for COVID-19, yet are asymptomatic or have mild

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Cytokine storm is the exaggerated immune response
               often observed in viral infections. It is also intimately linked
               with the progression of COVID-19 disease as well as associated
               complications and mortality. Therefore, targeting the cytokine
               storm might help in reducing COVID-19-associated health
               complications. The number of COVID-19 associated deaths (as of
               January 15, 2021; https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) in
               the USA is high (1199/million) as compared to countries like
               India (110/million). Although the reason behind this is not
               clear, spices may have some role in explaining this difference.
               Spices and herbs are used in different traditional medicines,
               especially in countries such as India to treat various chronic
               diseases due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
               properties. AIM: To evaluate the literature available on the
               anti-inflammatory properties of spices which might prove
               beneficial in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19
               associated cytokine storm. METHOD: A detailed literature search
               has been conducted on PubMed for collecting information
               pertaining to the COVID-19; the history, origin, key structural
               features, and mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2; the
               repurposed drugs in use for the management of COVID-19, and the
               anti-inflammatory role of spices to combat COVID-19 associated
               cytokine storm. KEY FINDINGS: The literature search resulted in
               numerous in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials that have
               reported the potency of spices to exert anti-inflammatory
               effects by regulating crucial molecular targets for
               inflammation. SIGNIFICANCE: As spices are derived from Mother
               Nature and are inexpensive, they are relatively safer to
               consume. Therefore, their anti-inflammatory property can be
               exploited to combat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.
               This review thus focuses on the current knowledge on the role of
               spices for the treatment of COVID-19 through suppression of

               was performed to identify cancer patients who received COVID-19
               diagnosis within the single healthcare system and presented to
               the ED within 30 days of COVID-19 positive date between May 1
               and December 31, 2020. RESULTS: In our 61 patients, the mean age
               was 72.5 years old, with 34\% of patients (n = 21) on active
               cancer therapy and 66\% (n = 40) on surveillance only. Most
               patients (n = 53) received their COVID-19 diagnosis within the
               ED, with 8 patients diagnosed prior to initial ED visit. The
               most common CT studies ordered within the ED were CT chest (n =
               25), CT abdomen/pelvis (A/P) (n = 20), CT head (n = 8), and CT
               chest/abdomen/pelvis (C/A/P) (n = 7). COVID-19 findings were
               present on 33 scans, findings of worsening malignancy on 12
               scans, and non-COVID non-cancer findings on 9 scans. Significant

               associated with the severity of disease. However, the mechanisms
               of the cytokine release are not clear. By using
               immunofluorescence staining we found that the number of CD11b
               positive immune cells including macrophages in the spleens of
               died COVID-19 patients, was significantly higher than that of
               the control patients. The incidence of apoptosis as measured by
               two apoptotic markers, TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3, in COVID-19
               patients' spleen cells is higher than that in control patients.
               By double immunostaining CD11b or CD68 and SARS-CoV-2 spike
               protein, it was found that up to 67\% of these immune cells were
               positive for spike protein, suggesting that viral infection

               compared with non-COVID-19 patients, autophagy may be inhibited

               find the association with morbidity and mortality after
               following up. METHODS: This study was conducted on 1,320
               confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the Ayatollah
               Taleghani and Shohada Tajrish Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The
               diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by standard protocols. The
               data on the platelet profile were retrospectively extracted from
               patients' electronic medical records consisted of platelet
               counts on admission, the next 7 days during the hospital stay,
               and on discharge. Patients were categorized into two groups,
               namely, ``non-severe presentation'' and ``severe presentation''
               based on clinical signs. RESULTS: There was no significant
               difference in platelet counts and thrombocytopenia between
               severe and non-severe, survivors and non-survivors, and severe
               survivors and severe non-survivors groups at the time of
               admission to the hospital. After 7 days, a trend toward an
               increase in platelet counts was seen in non-severe patients,
               survivors, and severe compared with severe patients,
               non-survivors, and severe non-survivors, respectively.
               CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications in
               COVID-19 patients are common and lead to a higher mortality

               COVID-19 causing the accelerated digitalization of the world.
               Given the significant global demand to provide telehealth
               services, it is important to explore patient receptiveness
               toward this alternative service model, particularly from regions
               where it has yet to be implemented. We conducted a
               cross-sectional study to understand the views and willingness of
               patients toward the use of telehealth for cancer genetic
               counseling. A survey was completed by 160 patients of the
               National Cancer Centre Singapore, and descriptive statistics
               were used to analyze the data. The study found that 95.6\% (n =
               153/160) of participants did not have prior telehealth
               experience. Most participants were willing or neutral toward
               having genetic counseling by phone (n = 114/160, 71.3\%) and
               video (n = 106/160, 66.3\%). However, majority prefer in-person
               appointments for first (n = 127/160, 79.4\%) and follow-up (n =
               97/160, 60.6\%) visits over telehealth. Majority agreed that a
               phone/video consultation would meet most of their needs but
               voiced concerns regarding privacy and sharing of information (n
               = 79/160, 49.4\% for phone; n = 74/160, 46.3\% for video) and
               whether their emotional needs could be met (n = 61/160, 38.1\%).
               Participants' age, employment status, income, mode of
               transportation to the appointment, and whether special
               arrangements were made to attend the in-person appointment were
               associated with receptivity to telehealth genetic counseling (p
               $\leq$ .05 for all). This study adds diversity to existing
               literature and demonstrates that patients from Asia are
               generally willing and accepting of the use of telehealth in a
               cancer genetics service. This will help meet increasing global
               demand of telehealth consultations in the post-pandemic new
               norm. Furthermore, it will also provide services for underserved
               populations and patients requiring urgent testing in a timely
               manner. Further studies are needed to explore the
               cost-effectiveness and fair billing methods, as well as

               finding in euthyroid patients with severe diseases. It is
               characterized by a reduction of serum T3 (fT3), sometimes
               followed by reduction of serum T4 (fT4). The relationship
               between thyroid hormones levels and mortality is well known and
               different studies showed a direct association between NTIS and
               mortality. The sudden spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus
               (SARS-CoV 2) infection (COVID-19) and its high mortality become
               a world healthcare problem. Our aim in this paper was to
               investigate if patients affected by COVID-19 presented NTIS and
               the relationship between thyroid function and severity of this
               infection. METHODS: We evaluated the thyroid function in two
               different groups of consecutive patients affected by COVID-19
               with respect to a control group of euthyroid patients. Group A

               respiratory syndrome formed the group B. Group C identified the
               control group of euthyroid patients. RESULTS: Patients from
               group A and group B showed a statistically significant reduction
               in fT3 and TSH compared to group C. In group B, compared to
               group A, a further statistically significant reduction of fT3

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients may experience
               fears regarding cancer recurrence (FoR) and of catching
               COVID-19. There could be unease for attending hospital clinics
               for face to face (F2F) examination. F2F benefit in cancer
               surveillance has to be balanced against the risk of virus
               transmission. This study aimed to report perceptions of fear of
               cancer and fear of COVID-19 and to report patient preference for
               follow-up consultation in HNC survivors during the COVID-19
               pandemic. METHODS: The study ran from lockdown in England on
               24th March to 29th July 2020. Patients were offered preference
               to postpone their consultation, to have it by telephone, or F2F.
               A postal survey was undertaken in the 2 weeks post-consultation
               (actual or postponed). RESULTS: There were 103 patients. Initial
               action by consultant and patient resulted in 51 postponed
               consultations, 35 telephone consultations and 17 F2F meetings,
               with 10 F2F triggered by the patient. There were 58 responders
               to the survey and most (39) had a clear preference for one mode
               of follow-up consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with
               half (19) preferring F2F. A similar response was seen regarding
               their consultations in general to address unmet needs and
               concerns, with 38 having a preferred mode, 29 preferring F2F.
               Serious fears about recurrence and COVID-19 were at relatively
               low levels with a tendency to be more concerned about
               recurrence. CONCLUSION: Any redesign of mode and frequency of
               out-patient follow-up in light of COVID-19 should be undertaken
               in discussion with patient groups and with individual patients.",

               immunosuppressive condition. Moreover, there are no data on
               vaccine efficacy regarding older patients with cancer.
               OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to evaluate the

               vaccination and collected serum samples from 36 patients; a
               group of medical doctors and nurses from our hospital was used
               as a control in a 1:2 ratio. RESULTS: The median age was 82
               years (range 80-89). Median serum IgG were 2396,10 AU/ml (range
               0-32,763,00) in patients with cancer and 8737,49 AU/ml
               (398.90-976,280,00) in the control group, p < 0.0001. Additional
               subgroup analyses were performed comparing males and females,

               public and private hospitals). We included all patients older
               than 18 years hospitalized during the 3 years and extracted PE
               status and COVID-19 status (from March 2020). Age, sex and risk
               factors for PE (such as obesity, cancer) were identified. We
               also extracted transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) and
               hospital death. The number of PE and the frequency of death in
               patients in 2019 and 2020 were described by month and by
               COVID-19 status. Logistic regressions were performed to identify
               the role of COVID-19 among other risk factors for PE in
               hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The overall number of patients
               hospitalized with PE increased by about 16\% in 2020 compared
               with 2019, and mortality also increased to 10.3\% (+ 1.2\%).
               These increases were mostly linked to COVID-19 waves, which were
               associated with PE hospitalization in COVID-19 patients (PE
               frequency was 3.7\%; 2.8\% in non-ICU and 8.8\% in ICU). The
               final PE odds ratio for COVID-19 hospitalized patients was 4
               compared with other hospitalized patients in 2020. The analyses
               of PE in non-COVID-19 patients showed a 2.7\% increase in 2020
               compared with the previous three years. CONCLUSION: In 2020, the
               overall number of patients hospitalized with PE in France
               increased compared to the previous three years despite a
               considerable decrease in scheduled hospitalizations.
               Nevertheless, proactive public policy focused on the prevention
               of PE in all patients should be encouraged.",

               pertaining to COVID-19 outcomes and safety of COVID-19
               vaccination in Russian patients with genitourinary (GU)
               malignancies. Aim of our analysis was to describe the
               characteristics of the COVID-19 infection course as well as
               preliminary safety and efficacy of Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine in
               patients with active GU malignancies. METHODS: Patients were
               retrospectively identified at nine cancer centers in different
               regions. Patients were included if COVID-19 was diagnosed by a
               polymerase chain reaction. Data from additional patients with GU
               cancers who had no positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test before
               vaccination and who received two doses of Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik
               V) between 11 February and 31 August 2021 were collected for
               safety assessment. Anonymized data were collected through an
               online registry covering demographics, treatments, and outcomes.
               RESULTS: The Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine was well tolerated; no grade
               3-5 toxicities were reported in 112 vaccinated metastatic GU
               cancer patients. The most common grade 1 adverse events (81\%)
               were injection site reactions (76\%), flu-like illness (68\%),
               and asthenia (49\%). Five patients experienced grade 2 chills
               (4.5\%) and 3 patients had grade 2 fever (2.7\%). With median
               follow-up of 6.2 months, two COVID-19 cases were confirmed by
               RT-PCR test in the vaccine group (of 112 participants; 1.8\%).
               Eighty-eight patients with COVID-19 disease were included in the
               analysis. The average age as of the study enrollment was 66
               (range 39-81) and the majority of patients were male with renal
               cell carcinoma (RCC). Thirty-six patients (41\%) had evidence of
               metastatic disease, of these 22 patients were receiving systemic
               therapy. More than half of patients required hospitalization.
               Fifty-four patients (61\%) experienced complications. Sixteen
               patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia required mechanical
               ventilator support. Sixteen patients (18\%) died in a median of
               23.5 days after the date of COVID-19 diagnosis was established.
               The 3-month survival rate was 82\%. Clinical and/or radiographic
               progression of cancer during COVID-19 infection or the
               subsequent 3 months was observed in 10 patients (11.4\%).
               CONCLUSION: Patients with GU malignancies are at increased risk
               of mortality from COVID-19 infection when compared to the
               general population. Vaccination could be safe in GU cancer

               aimed to describe and compare the demographics, medical
               conditions, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients living with
               obesity (PLWO) to those of patients living without obesity.
               METHODS: We conducted a cohort study based on
               outpatient/inpatient care and claims data from January to June
               2020 from Spain, the UK, and the US. We used six databases
               standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two
               non-mutually exclusive cohorts of patients diagnosed and/or
               hospitalized with COVID-19; patients were followed from index
               date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of
               demographics, prior medical conditions, and 30-days outcomes
               (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. RESULTS:
               We included 627 044 (Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336, and US: 502 650)
               diagnosed and 160 013 (Spain: 18 197, US: 141 816) hospitalized
               patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of obesity was higher
               among patients hospitalized (39.9\%, 95\%CI: 39.8-40.0) than
               among those diagnosed with COVID-19 (33.1\%; 95\%CI: 33.0-33.2).
               In both cohorts, PLWO were more often female. Hospitalized PLWO
               were younger than patients without obesity. Overall, COVID-19
               PLWO were more likely to have prior medical conditions, present
               with cardiovascular and respiratory events during
               hospitalization, or require intensive services compared to
               COVID-19 patients without obesity. CONCLUSION: We show that PLWO
               differ from patients without obesity in a wide range of medical
               conditions and present with more severe forms of COVID-19, with
               higher hospitalization rates and intensive services
               requirements. These findings can help guiding preventive
               strategies of COVID-19 infection and complications and

               ``anti-COVID-19'' nutraceuticals for patients with cancer. We
               conducted a PubMed database search aimed at identifying the most

               nutraceuticals, we searched PubMed again regarding their safety
               for patients with cancer. Fifty-four total records (52
               independent studies) were retrieved, pertaining to vitamin D,
               vitamin C, selenium, omega-3 fatty acids, and zinc. Vitamin D
               results from 23 articles indicated safe use, but two articles
               indicated potential harm. All 14 articles for vitamin C and five
               out of six articles for selenium indicated the safety of use
               (one study for selenium suggested harm with high-dose
               supplementation). Results for omega-3 fatty acids (seven
               articles) and zinc (one article), however, were rather mixed

               selenium supplements are likely safe or even beneficial at
               typically recommended doses; however, caution is urged with
               omega-3 fatty acid supplements, and zinc supplements should
               likely be avoided. More experimental research is needed, and

               designated hospital in Wuhan, China, and 148 hospitalized
               patients with COVID-19 in the same hospital participated in this

               Pandemic-related psychological stressors contributed to
               psychological symptoms for both populations. Concern about
               patients was one aspect of psychological stressors of frontline

               recommendations grounded mainly in common sense and expert
               consensus, such as medical therapy for early-stage breast and

               delay-related worries. Satisfaction with patient-physician
               communication and the availability of a delay strategy were key
               factors in patients' acceptance of the situation; perceived lack
               of communication prompted a few patients to seek care elsewhere.
               DISCUSSION: The clinical effect of delay in cancer surgery will
               take years to fully understand, but there are immediate steps
               that can be taken to improve the patient experience of delays in
               care, including elicitation of individual patient perspectives
               and ongoing communication. More work is needed to understand the
               wider experiences of patients, especially minority,
               socioeconomically disadvantaged, and uninsured patients, who
               encounter delays in oncologic care.",

               reducing visits to hospitals and guarantee continuity of care.
               We developed a home care project called Home Se-Cure (HSC) to
               guarantee the continuity of oral, intramuscular, and
               subcutaneous cancer therapy during COVID-19. The Home Se-Cure
               project included cancer patients living near Galliera Hospital.
               Patients received home visits by registered nurses (RNs),
               whoperformed blood tests and delivered cancer therapies.
               Patients were instructed to take drugs after blood test results
               and therapy confirmation by oncologists. Sixty-six patients
               decided to participate and 38 declined the service. A customer
               satisfaction questionnaire was administered to a subgroup of
               patients participating in the project. The most prevalent
               disease in the HSC group was prostate cancer. The mean age of

               (COVID-19) has emerged as an international pandemic. COVID-19
               patients with myocardial injury might need special attention.
               However, an understanding on this aspect remains unclear. This
               study aimed to illustrate clinical characteristics and the
               prognostic value of myocardial injury to COVID-19 patients.
               METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study finally
               included 304 hospitalized COVID-19 cases confirmed by real-time
               reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from January 11
               to March 25, 2020. Myocardial injury was determined by serum
               high-sensitivity troponin I (Hs-TnI). The primary endpoint was
               COVID-19-associated mortality. RESULTS: Of 304 COVID-19 patients
               (median age, 65 years; 52.6\% males), 88 patients (27.3\%) died
               (61 patients with myocardial injury, 27 patients without
               myocardial injury on admission). COVID-19 patients with
               myocardial injury had more comorbidities (hypertension, chronic
               obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and
               cerebrovascular disease); lower lymphocyte counts, higher
               C-reactive protein (CRP; median, 84.9 vs. 28.5 mg/L; p < .001),
               procalcitonin levels (median, 0.29 vs. 0.06 ng/ml; p < .001),
               inflammatory and immune response markers; more frequent need for
               noninvasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation; and
               was associated with higher mortality incidence (hazard ratio
               [HR] = 7.02; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.45-11.08; p <
               .001) than those without myocardial injury. Myocardial injury
               (HR = 4.55; 95\% CI, 2.49-8.31; p < .001), senior age, CRP
               levels, and novel coronavirus pneumonia types on admission were
               independent predictors to mortality in COVID-19 patients.
               CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury on
               admission is associated with more severe clinical presentation
               and biomarkers. Myocardial injury and higher Hs-TnI are both
               strongest independent predictors to COVID-19-related mortality

               in the time of {COVID-19}",
  author    = "Bultz, Barry D and Watson, Linda",
  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Cancer-related biopsychosocial distress is highly
               prevalent across the cancer care continuum. The implementation
               of screening patients for biopsychosocial distress has become a
               standard of practice in cancer care. With the presence of
               COVID-19, clinical care has shifted from in-person care to
               virtual care in many instances. One of the realities of COVID-19
               is the significant decrease in screening patients for
               biopsychosocial symptom burden. METHODS: Given that screening
               for distress has become an accreditation standard in many cancer
               programs, in the province of Alberta, Canada, all patients are
               screened for distress with every visit to the cancer centre.
               Given the presence of COVID-19, much of cancer care has shifted
               to being delivered virtually (through mediums such as Zoom). In
               this paper, we present pre- and post-COVID data on the frequency
               of distress screening and its impact on patient care. RESULTS: A
               review of pre- and post-COVID-19 screening for distress
               questionnaires revealed that patients who received virtual care
               were less satisfied in the areas of emotional support and
               received less resources and referrals to supportive care.
               CONCLUSION: The rapid integration of virtual care without the
               inclusion of a standardized distress screening tool was akin to
               a natural experiment, as two groups (virtual and in-person
               clinic patients) received different levels of care and
               interventions. Without the inclusion of distress screening, the
               clinical conversation around symptoms is less likely to occur
               and results in fewer referrals to best practices in supportive
               care services. Lessons learned about virtual cancer care without
               distress screening in the time of COVID-19 demonstrates
               significantly fewer patients being screened for distress and
               subsequently has resulted in less supportive care referrals.
               Going forward, we must find ways to ensure that virtual cancer
               care continues to support distress screening and best
               patient-centric care.",

               Results: During the study period (from 21 April to 30 May 2020),
               3642 patients participated in the study. The majority of

               the immunological dynamics of severe COVID-19 patients with
               different degrees of illness, and upon long-term recovery. We
               analyzed immune cellular subsets and SARS-CoV-2-specific
               antibody isotypes of 66 COVID-19 patients admitted to the
               Hospital Cl{\'\i}nico Universidad de Chile, which were
               categorized according to the WHO ten-point clinical progression
               score. These included 29 moderate patients (score 4-5) and 37
               severe patients under either high flow oxygen nasal cannula (18
               patients, score 6), or invasive mechanical ventilation (19
               patients, score 7-9), plus 28 convalescent patients and 28
               healthy controls. Furthermore, six severe patients that
               recovered from the disease were longitudinally followed over 300
               days. Our data indicate that severe COVID-19 patients display
               increased frequencies of plasmablasts, activated T cells and
               SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies compared to moderate and
               convalescent patients. Remarkably, within the severe COVID-19
               group, patients rapidly progressing into invasive mechanical
               ventilation show higher frequencies of plasmablasts, monocytes,
               eosinophils, Th1 cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients
               under high flow oxygen nasal cannula. These findings demonstrate
               that severe COVID-19 patients progressing into invasive
               mechanical ventilation show a distinctive type of immunity. In
               addition, patients that recover from severe COVID-19 begin to
               regain normal proportions of immune cells 100 days after
               hospital discharge and maintain high levels of
               SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG throughout the study, which is an
               indicative sign of immunological memory. Thus, this work can

               BACKGROUND: High mortality rates were reported for surgical
               patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic.
               However, the indirect impact of the pandemic on this cohort is
               not understood, and risk predictors are yet to be identified.
               METHODS: PREDICT is an international longitudinal cohort study
               comprising surgical patients presenting to hospital between
               March and August 2020, conducted alongside a survey of staff
               redeployment and departmental restructuring. A subgroup analysis
               of 3176 adult emergency patients, recruited by 55 teams across

               surgical patients, all-cause in-hospital mortality (IHM) was
               3.6\%, compared to 15.5\% for those with COVID-19. However, only
               14.1\% received a COVID-19 test on admission in March,
               increasing to 76.5\% by July.Higher Clinical Frailty Scale
               scores (CFS >7 aOR 18.87), ASA grade above 2 (aOR 4.29), and
               COVID-19 infection (aOR 5.12) were independently associated with
               significantly increased IHM.The peak months of the first wave
               were independently associated with significantly higher IHM
               (March aOR 4.34; April aOR 4.25; May aOR 3.97), compared to
               non-peak months.During the study, UK operating theatre capacity
               decreased by a mean of 63.6\% with a concomitant 27.3\%
               reduction in surgical staffing. CONCLUSION: The first wave of
               the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted surgical patients,
               both directly through co-morbid infection and indirectly as
               shown by increasing mortality in peak months, irrespective of
               COVID-19 status.Higher CFS scores and ASA grades strongly
               predict outcomes in surgical patients and are an important risk
               assessment tool during the pandemic.",

               screening mammography cancellations and rescheduling during the
               COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Scheduled screening mammograms
               during three time periods were retrospectively reviewed:
               state-mandated shutdown (3/17/2020-6/16/2020) during which
               screening mammography was cancelled, a period of 2 months
               immediately after screening mammography resumed
               (6/17/2020-8/16/2020), and a representative period prior to
               COVID-19 (6/17/2019-8/16/2019). Relative risk of cancellation
               before COVID-19 and after reopening was compared for age,
               race/ethnicity, insurance, history of chronic disease, and exam
               location, controlling for other collected variables. Risk of
               failure to reschedule was similarly compared between all 3 time
               periods. RESULTS: Overall cancellation rate after reopening was
               higher than before shutdown (7663/16595, 46\% vs 5807/15792,
               37\%; p < 0.001). Relative risk of cancellation after reopening
               increased with age (1.20 vs 1.27 vs 1.36 for ages at 25th, 50th,
               and 75th quartile or 53, 61, and 70 years, respectively, p <
               0.001). Relative risk of cancellation was also higher among
               Medicare patients (1.41) compared to Medicaid and those with
               other providers (1.26 and 1.21, respectively, p < 0.001) and
               non-whites compared to whites (1.34 vs 1.25, p = 0.03).
               Rescheduling rate during shutdown was higher than before
               COVID-19 and after reopening for all patients (10,658/13593,
               78\%, 3569/5807, 61\%, and 4243/7663, respectively, 55\%, p <
               0.001). Relative risk of failure to reschedule missed mammogram
               was higher in hospitals compared to outpatient settings both
               during shutdown and after reopening (0.62 vs 0.54, p = 0.005 and
               1.29 vs 1.03, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Minority
               race/ethnicity, Medicare insurance, and advanced age were
               associated with increased risk of screening mammogram
               cancellation during COVID-19.",

               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is presenting as
               a systemic disease associated with vascular inflammation and
               endothelial injury. Severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection induce
               acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and there is still an
               ongoing debate on whether COVID-19 ARDS and its perfusion defect
               differs from ARDS induced by other causes. Beside
               pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1 $\beta$
               [IL-1$\beta$] or IL-6), several main pathological phenomena have
               been seen because of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction:
               hypercoagulation reflected by fibrin degradation products called
               D-dimers, micro- and macrothrombosis and pathological
               angiogenesis. Direct endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 is not
               likely to occur and ACE-2 expression by EC is a matter of
               debate. Indeed, endothelial damage reported in severely ill
               patients with COVID-19 could be more likely secondary to
               infection of neighboring cells and/or a consequence of
               inflammation. Endotheliopathy could give rise to
               hypercoagulation by alteration in the levels of different
               factors such as von Willebrand factor. Other than thrombotic
               events, pathological angiogenesis is among the recent findings.
               Overexpression of different proangiogenic factors such as
               vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast
               growth factor (FGF-2) or placental growth factors (PlGF) have
               been found in plasma or lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients.
               Finally, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an emergency myelopoiesis
               associated to deregulated immunity and mobilization of
               endothelial progenitor cells, leading to features of acquired
               hematological malignancies or cardiovascular disease, which are
               discussed in this review. Altogether, this review will try to
               elucidate the pathophysiology of thrombotic complications,
               pathological angiogenesis and EC dysfunction, allowing better
               insight in new targets and antithrombotic protocols to better
               address vascular system dysfunction. Since treating SARS-CoV-2
               infection and its potential long-term effects involves targeting
               the vascular compartment and/or mobilization of immature immune
               cells, we propose to define COVID-19 and its complications as a
               systemic vascular acquired hemopathy.",

               in cancer patients with COVID-19 as well as by the impact of the
               COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care. Patients with cancer
               constitute a heterogeneous population that exhibits distinct
               mechanisms of immune dysfunction, associated with distinct
               systemic features of hot (T-cell-inflamed/infiltrated) and cold

               while, contrastingly, the latter show the profile of a
               senescent/quiescent immune system. Thus, the evolution of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of cancers can show
               distinct trajectories which could lead to a variety of clinical
               and pathophysiological outcomes. The altered immunological

               based therapies that have significantly improved cancer

               prevalent in cancer patients that are associated to the outcomes
               of SARS-CoV-2 infection will help to identify the high-risk

  abstract  = "The global outbreak of the SARS-Cov-2 virus in 2020 has killed
               millions of people worldwide and forced large parts of the world
               into lockdowns. While multiple vaccine programs are starting to
               immunize the global population, there is no direct cure for
               COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-Cov-2 infection. A
               common symptom in patients is a decrease in T cells, called
               lymphopenia. It is as of yet unclear what the exact role of T
               cells are in the immune response to COVID-19. The research so
               far has mainly focused on the involvement of classical
               $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells. However, another subset of T cells
               called $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells could have an important role to
               play. As part of the innate immune system, $\gamma$$\delta$ T
               cells respond to inflammation and stressed or infected cells.
               The $\gamma$$\delta$ T cell subset appears to be particularly
               affected by lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients and commonly
               express activation and exhaustion markers. Particularly in
               children, this subset of T cells seems to be most affected. This
               is interesting and relevant because $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells are
               more prominent and active in early life. Their specific
               involvement in this group of patients could indicate a
               significant role for $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells in this disease.
               Furthermore, they seem to be involved in other viral infections
               and were able to kill SARS infected cells in vitro.
               $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells can take up, process and present
               antigens from microbes and human cells. As e.g.
               tumour-associated antigens are presented by MHC on
               $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells to classical T-cells, we argue here
               that it stands to reason that also viral antigens, such as
               SARS-Cov-2-derived peptides, can be presented in the same way.
               $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells are already used for medical purposes
               in oncology and have potential in cancer therapy. As
               $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells are not necessarily able to distinguish
               between a transformed and a virally infected cell it could
               therefore be of great interest to investigate further the
               relationship between COVID-19 and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells.",

               (Spain) for cancer patients. METHOD: a retrospective cohort

               database including all cancer patients treated in the period of
               2018-2021. RESULTS: 1967 cases were studied. There was a drop in
               cancer cases (p = 0.008), deaths at the PC hospital (p < 0.001),
               and referrals from primary care (p < 0.001). However, there was
               a rise in highly complex clinical situations (p = 0.020) and in
               ECOG performance status scores of 3-4 (p < 0.001). The pandemic

               providers responded that cancer patients required
               community-linked services and discharge plans, whereas 50.7\%
               and 79.2\% of cancer patients noted the importance of
               community-linked services and discharge plans, respectively.
               Social workers, among healthcare providers, showed the most
               positive experience about connecting patients to community
               services since 69.7\% of them responded as ``excellent''.
               However, as a group, cancer patients considered the necessity of
               community-linked service as less important, as only 50.7\%
               responded as agreeing it was necessary. The barriers to
               community linkage were the lack of communication among the
               different professions of healthcare providers, and the ambiguity
               in their roles. The findings of this study will inform future
               community-linked health research, policies and systems for
               cancer patients. In particular, an in-depth interview with
               cancer patients will be required to explore their lack of
               acknowledgment about the necessity of community-linked services.
               Therefore, this study is expected to contribute to the
               improvement and supplementation of cancer policies.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The process of enrolling participants is an
               important component and often a time-consuming step in
               scientific research projects. Due to different financial,
               organisational and ethical framework conditions, the enrolment
               of participants is often a challenge. In this article, we report
               our experiences of enrolling patients in clinical trials made in
               the project ``Psycho-oncological care of cancer patients with a
               migration background - a mixed methods study'' (POM). METHODS:
               Participants were recruited through outpatient haemato-oncology
               practices. Patients and relatives were primarily made aware of
               the project by the treating physicians and recruited to
               participate in qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Nine patients
               and relatives were interviewed nationwide in individual
               qualitative interviews. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic,
               there were other patient enrolment challenges. In many cases,
               participation was refused. The reasons included: ``not
               interested'', the use of the terms ``psycho-oncology'' or
               ``person with a migration background'', family denying
               permission to participate, no face-to-face interview due to the
               COVID-19 pandemic as well as too much emotional distress and
               deterioration of health after prior consent. DISCUSSION:
               Enrolling study participants from vulnerable groups for a
               sensitive topic such as psycho-oncology entails multiple
               challenges. In order to achieve successful study inclusion,
               regular telephone and written exchanges with the respective
               practice staff proved to be helpful, allowing an overview of
               challenges to be gained and study inclusion to be evaluated and
               adjusted in a timely manner. CONCLUSION: In research projects
               with vulnerable groups and on sensitive topics, both a
               target-group-specific, sensitive approach in plain language
               (layman's terms) and regular consultations with the persons
               responsible for study inclusion in care facilities should take
               place in order to adapt the existing procedure during the study
               inclusion process, if necessary.",

               of the use of teledentistry for patients undergoing treatment of
               oral and head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus,
               Web of Science, Lilacs, Embase, Open Grey, Google Scholar, and
               Jstor databases for studies referring to the management,

               oral and head and neck cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
               RESULTS: We found 356 references in the databases, 209 after
               duplicates removal, 23 met criteria for full-text reading, and
               11 studies were included for qualitative synthesis, in four
               categories: virtual visits, use of remote technology, patient's
               satisfaction, multidisciplinary approach in teledentistry. We
               found that 78\% of patients currently preferred teledentistry;
               92\% of patients would recommend the use of video consultation
               to other patients. The continuity of dental care, the reduction
               of patient visits to the hospital, the reduction of the risk of
               infection with the coronavirus, and limitation of face-to-face
               consultations to protect health professionals are benefits that
               reinforce the use of teledentistry by health institutions. Two
               studies showed patients' satisfaction with the use of
               teledentistry in monitoring cancer patients and showed an
               improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The teledentistry,
               as a remote technology for monitoring patients with oral and
               head and neck cancer, is well accepted by patients in
               preliminary studies. Although these studies pointed out some
               benefits of using remote technologies for the care of cancer
               patients, further robust scientific evidence is still needed in
               this regard.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Older adults living with cancer have been described
               as more susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and
               in need of special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. For
               cancer survivors, the first year post-treatment is a critical
               time because many individuals transition back to their primary
               care provider and adjust to physical and psychosocial changes
               that occurred during their cancer treatment. In this
               longitudinal qualitative study, we followed a cohort of older
               adult cancer survivors through the first three waves of the
               pandemic to describe their experiences as a means for providing
               recommendations for how oncology nurses can tailor support to
               this unique population. DATA SOURCES: We conducted individual,
               semi-structured qualitative interviews with 24 older adults at
               three time points during the pandemic. Data were analyzed
               drawing from interpretive descriptive methodologies. CONCLUSION:
               Older adult cancer survivors' needs shifted during the pandemic
               from feeling confident and self-assured during the early days of
               COVID-19 to growing uncertainty and unease about their health
               and well-being. The main survivorship concerns included a
               preference for in-person appointments (as opposed to virtual),
               barriers to caregiver attendance at appointments, and diminished
               access to health care services. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING
               PRACTICE: Oncology nurses play a critical role providing care to
               older adult cancer survivors and are most familiar with unique
               patient needs and the gaps in services they face. We provide
               recommendations for oncology nursing practice that consider the

               apolipoproteins for COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: We
               conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using
               observational studies that reported the association between
               apolipoproteins and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients.
               Newcastle-Ottawa was used for the quality assessment of included
               studies. Effects measurements were shown as odds ratios (ORs)
               with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), and Egger-test was
               developed for assessing the risk of bias publication. RESULTS:
               We analyzed 12 cohort studies (n = 3580). Patients with low
               ApoliproteinA1 (ApoA1) (OR 0.35; 95\%CI 0.24 to 0.49; P < 0.001)

               ApoB/ApoA1 ratio showed no statistically significant association

               significant association with a high risk of all-cause mortality.
               CONCLUSION: We suggest that adequate levels of ApoA1 and ApoB

               aggressive due to multiple factors such as age, comorbidities,
               and immunosuppression. In this pandemic era, COVID-19 causes
               lymphopenia, cancer cell awakening, inflammatory diseases, and a

               the oropharyngeal microbiome has been proposed as a major hub
               integrating viral and host immune signals. Early studies
               suggested that infections with Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are
               associated with changes of the upper and lower airway
               microbiome, and that specific microbial signatures may predict
               COVID-19 illness. However, the results are not conclusive, as
               critical illness can drastically alter a patient's microbiome
               through multiple confounders. METHODS: To study oropharyngeal
               microbiome profiles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical
               confounders, and prediction models in COVID-19, we performed a
               multi-center, cross-sectional clinical study analyzing
               oropharyngeal microbial metagenomes in healthy adults, patients
               with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections, or with mild, moderate and
               severe COVID-19 (n=322 participants). RESULTS: In contrast to
               mild infections, patients admitted to a hospital with moderate
               or severe COVID-19 showed dysbiotic microbial configurations,
               which were significantly pronounced in patients treated with
               broad-spectrum antibiotics, receiving invasive mechanical
               ventilation, or when sampling was performed during prolonged
               hospitalization. In contrast, specimens collected early after
               admission allowed us to segregate microbiome features predictive
               of hospital COVID-19 mortality utilizing machine learning
               models. Taxonomic signatures were found to perform better than
               models utilizing clinical variables with Neisseria and
               Haemophilus species abundances as most important features.
               CONCLUSION: In addition to the infection per se, several factors
               shape the oropharyngeal microbiome of severely affected COVID-19
               patients and deserve consideration in the interpretation of the
               role of the microbiome in severe COVID-19. Nevertheless, we were
               able to extract microbial features that can help to predict

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: According to the recommendation of the Centers for
               Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), getting influenza vaccines
               during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemics is especially
               important for people with certain underlying medical conditions,
               like cancer. Due to the similarities between the symptoms of
               influenza and COVID-19, receiving the flu vaccine in suspicious
               cases can be helpful because it will make it easier to request a
               medical test and diagnosis. In this study, the value of
               influenza vaccination in the cancer population was investigated.
               METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, all cancer patients who
               were referred to our clinic and had eligibility to receive the
               flu vaccine were included in our study for following up clinical
               signs every week for one month. All patients who were vaccinated
               from October 1 to November 15, 2020 were investigated. The most
               side effects that were followed were fever, runny nose, bone
               pain, and life-threatening or persistent adverse effects.
               RESULTS: From a total of 288 patients (median age: 52 years
               (range 18-79), 112 (38.9\%) males and 176 (61.1\%) female) with
               different types of cancers, only two patients had an adverse
               effect of vaccination (including bone pain, runny nose, and
               fatigue), and one had COVID-19 ten days after vaccination. The
               rest of the patients did not show any side effects due to flu
               vaccination after one month of follow-up. Cancer patients are
               recommended to receive the flu vaccine annually during the
               pandemic and after the end of this pandemic, usually during the

               (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are essential. We conducted this
               prospective study of patients with cancer vaccinated with
               BNT162b2 and monitored for antibody response and safety. The aim
               was to evaluate the rate of seropositivity and define predictors
               for non-reactive immune response. Furthermore, we evaluated the
               frequency and the severity of adverse events. METHODS: The study
               included patients with solid tumours undergoing anticancer
               treatment and immunocompetent health-care workers serving as
               controls. Serum titres of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
               immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralising antibodies were measured
               2-4 weeks after each vaccine dose. RESULTS: The analysis
               included 129 patients, of which 70.5\% patients were metastatic.
               Patients were treated with chemotherapy (55\%), immunotherapy
               (34.1\%), biological agents (24.8\%), hormonal treatment (8.5\%)
               and radiotherapy (4.6\%), that were given either alone or in
               combinations. The seropositivity rate among patients with cancer
               and controls was 32.4\% versus 59.8\% (p < 0.0001) after the
               first dose and 84.1\% versus 98.9\% (p < 0.0001) after the
               second dose, respectively. Median RBD-IgG titre was lower among
               patients than controls (p < 0.0001). Patients who were
               seronegative after the second dose had significantly more
               comorbidities than that with patients with seropositivity
               (77.8\% vs 41.1\%, respectively, p = 0.0042). CONCLUSION:
               Adequate antibody response after BNT162b2 vaccination was
               achieved after two doses but not after one dose, in patients
               with cancer vaccinated during anticancer therapy.",

               multidisciplinary aspects of cancer care. Recent reports
               described rapid uptake and various benefits for patients and

               after the pandemic. Objective: To examine attitudes and
               perceptions of multidisciplinary cancer care clinicians toward
               telehealth and secure messages. Design, Setting, and
               Participants: Cross-sectional specialty-specific survey (ie,
               some questions appear only for relevant specialties) among
               multidisciplinary cancer care clinicians, collected from April
               29, 2020, to June 5, 2020. Participants were all 285 clinicians
               in the fields of medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical
               oncology, survivorship, and oncology navigation from all 21
               community cancer centers of Kaiser Permanente Northern
               California. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinician satisfaction,
               perceived benefits and challenges of telehealth, perceived
               quality of telehealth and secure messaging, preferred visit and
               communication types for different clinical activities, and
               preferences regarding postpandemic telehealth use. Results: A
               total of 202 clinicians (71\%) responded (104 of 128 medical
               oncologists, 34 of 37 radiation oncologists, 16 of 62 breast
               surgeons, 18 of 28 navigators, and 30 of 30 survivorship
               experts; 57\% (116 of 202) were women; 73\% [147 of 202] between
               ages 36-55 years). Seventy-six percent (n = 154) were satisfied
               with telehealth without statistically significant variations
               based on clinician characteristics. In-person visits were
               thought to promote a strong patient-clinician connection by 99\%
               (n = 137) of respondents compared with 77\% (n = 106) for video
               visits, 43\% (n = 59) for telephone, and 14\% (n = 19) for
               secure messages. The most commonly cited benefits of telehealth
               to clinicians included reduced commute (79\%; n = 160), working
               from home (74\%; n = 149), and staying on time (65\%; n = 132);
               the most commonly cited negative factors included internet
               connection (84\%; n = 170) or equipment problems (72\%; n =
               146), or physical examination needed (64\%; n = 131). Most
               respondents (59\%; n = 120) thought that video is adequate to
               manage the greater part of patient care in general; and most
               deemed various telehealth modalities suitable for any of the
               queried types of patient-clinician activities. For some specific
               activities, less than half of respondents thought that only an
               in-person visit is acceptable (eg, 49\%; n = 66 for end-of-life
               discussion, 35\%; n = 58 for new diagnosis). Most clinicians
               (82\%; n = 166) preferred to maintain or increase use of
               telehealth after the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: In
               this survey of multidisciplinary cancer care clinicians in the
               COVID-19 era, telehealth was well received and often preferred
               by most cancer care clinicians, who deemed it appropriate to
               manage most aspects of cancer care. As telehealth use becomes
               routine in some cancer care settings, video and telephone visits
               and use of asynchronous secure messaging with patients in cancer
               care has clear potential to extend beyond the pandemic period.",

               (Garc{\'\i}a-Su{\'a}rez et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). On the
               contrary, others pointed out that this association is not
               significant (Brar et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020a). Although
               previous systematic reviews have investigated this important
               issue (Wang and Huang, 2020), the heterogeneity of findings is
               obvious and the general conclusion has remained unclear.
               Considering this ambiguity, it is difficult for clinicians to
               make therapeutic decisions when facing patients with both cancer
               and COVID-19; therefore, a high-quality and accurate evaluation
               of the impact of anticancer treatments on COVID-19 patients is
               necessary. Accordingly, we conducted a pooled analysis with the
               original data of each patient for the first time to provide a
               comprehensive perspective into the association between
               anticancer regimens and the outcomes of cancer patients with
               COVID-19.",

               undergoing radiotherapy by comparing the patterns of unplanned
               radiotherapy interruption before and after the COVID-19
               pandemic. We enrolled patients who received their first dose of
               radiotherapy for breast cancer between January 28 and July 31,
               2019 and between January 28, 2020, and July 31, 2020. We
               compared the radiotherapy interruption patterns in 2019 with
               those in 2020 to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
               treatment interruption. Between January 28 and July 31, 2019,
               287 patients with breast cancer received radiotherapy. Among
               them, 19 patients (6.6\%) experienced treatment interruption;
               the reasons for treatment interruption were radiotherapy-related
               side effects (10 patients, 52.6\%), other medical reasons (three
               patients, 15.8\%), and personal reasons (six patients, 31.6\%).
               Between January 28 and July 31, 2020, 279 patients with breast
               cancer received radiotherapy. Among them, 23 patients (8.2\%)
               experienced treatment interruption; the reasons for treatment
               interruption were radiotherapy-related side effects (eight
               patients, 35\%) and COVID-19 screening clinic-related reasons
               (six patients, 26.1\%). Among the six patients with screening
               clinic-related causes of radiotherapy interruption, five had
               asymptomatic fever and one had mild cold-like symptoms. The
               duration of treatment interruption was longer in patients with
               screening clinic-related interruptions than in those with
               interruptions because of other causes (p = 0.019). Multivariate
               analysis showed that cancer stage and radiotherapy volume did
               not significantly affect treatment interruption. The

               continues to spread, it remains unclear how vulnerable
               populations with preexisting health conditions like cancer have
               been affected. METHODS: Between July and September of 2020, the
               authors conducted a cross-sectional study that surveyed 2661
               patients with breast cancer who were registered in the Chicago
               Multiethnic Epidemiologic Breast Cancer Cohort and received 1300
               responses (71.5\% White patients and 22.4\% Black patients). The
               survey measured the psychosocial well-being of participants
               before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined whether
               they experienced any type of financial challenges or treatment
               disruption. RESULTS: The results indicated that feelings of
               isolation increased significantly during the pandemic.
               Meanwhile, the overall median isolation/stress score was 1.2 on
               a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always), which was not
               significantly different between White patients and Black
               patients. One-third of patients experienced some type of
               financial challenge during this time. Medicaid recipients, of
               whom almost 80\% were Black, were more likely to experience
               financial challenges. In addition, approximately one-fourth of
               patients experienced difficulty getting treatment. CONCLUSIONS:
               This study indicates that the quality of life of patients with
               breast cancer and their scheduled treatments have been adversely
               affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest
               that more support should be provided by hospital centers and the
               medical research community to patients with cancer during this
               challenging pandemic. LAY SUMMARY: The authors surveyed patients
               with breast cancer in Chicago using a questionnaire to examine
               how their lives have been affected during the coronavirus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The results indicate that the
               lives of patients with breast cancer and their scheduled
               treatments have been adversely affected during the pandemic. In
               addition, patients who were covered by Medicaid, most of whom
               were Black, were more likely to experience financial challenges.
               The findings suggest that hospital centers and the medical
               research community should reach out and provide more information
               to support patients with cancer during this challenging

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It is well established that cancer patients infected
               with SARS-CoV-2 are at particularly elevated risk of adverse
               outcomes, but the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk
               between cancer patients and cancer-free individuals has been
               poorly investigated on a population-basis. METHODS: A
               population-based study was thus conducted in Friuli Venezia
               Giulia region, northeastern Italy, to estimate prevalence and
               determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection among cancer patients, as
               compared to cancer-free individuals, and to evaluate adverse
               outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study included 263,042
               individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February-December 2020 with
               cancer history retrieved through the regional cancer registry.
               Odds ratios (ORs) of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with corresponding
               95\% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated using
               multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for sex and
               age. Hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for sex and age for intensive
               care unit (ICU) admission and all-cause death were estimated
               using Cox models. RESULTS: Among 26,394 cancer patients tested
               for SARS-CoV-2, the prevalence of infection was 11.7\% versus
               16.2\% among 236,648 cancer-free individuals, with a
               corresponding OR = 0.59 (95\% CI: 0.57-0.62). The prevalence was
               much higher (29\% in both groups) during the second pandemic
               wave (October-December 2020). Among cancer patients, age
               $\geq$80 years and cancer diagnosis $\geq$13 months before
               SARS-CoV-2 testing were the major risk factors of infection.
               Among 3098 infected cancer patients, the fatality rate was
               17.4\% versus 15.8\% among 23,296 negative ones (HR = 1.63, 95\%
               CI: 1.49-1.78), and versus 5.0\% among 38,268 infected
               cancer-free individuals (HR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 1.12-1.36). No
               significant differences emerged when considering ICU admission
               risk. CONCLUSION: Albeit cancer patients reported reduced
               SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, those infected showed higher
               mortality than uninfected ones and infected cancer-free
               population. Study findings claim for continuing to protect

               Patients were recruited from May 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020.
               Demographic, laboratory, imaging features, and outcomes were
               collected. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to
               detect factors affecting mortality. RESULTS: This retrospective
               cohort study included 125 patients with chronic hepatitis C and
               COVID-19 co-infection, of which 64 (51.20\%) had liver cirrhosis
               and 40 (32.00\%) died. Fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue were
               the most frequent symptoms in patients with liver cirrhosis.
               Cough, sore throat, fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea were
               significantly more common in patients with liver cirrhosis than
               in non-cirrhotic patients. There was no difference between
               patients with and without cirrhosis regarding comorbidities.
               Fifteen patients (23.40\%) with liver cirrhosis presented with
               hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with liver cirrhosis were more
               likely than non-cirrhotic patients to have combined ground-glass
               opacities and consolidations in CT chest scans: 28 (43.75\%) vs
               4 (6.55\%), respectively (P value < 0.001). These patients also
               were more likely to have severe COVID-19 infection, compared to
               patients without liver cirrhosis: 29 (45.31\%) vs 11 (18.04\%),
               respectively (P value < 0.003). Mortality was higher in patients
               with liver cirrhosis, compared to those with no cirrhosis: 33
               (51.56\%) vs 9 (14.75\%), respectively (P value < 0.001). All
               patients in Child-Pugh class A recovered and were discharged.
               Cirrhotic mortality occurred among decompensated patients only.
               A multivariate regression analysis revealed the following
               independent factors affecting mortality: Male gender (OR 7.17,
               95\%CI: 2.19-23.51; P value = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR
               4.03, 95\%CI: 1.49-10.91; P value = 0.006), and liver cirrhosis
               (OR 1.103, 95\%CI: 1.037-1.282; P value < 0.0001). We found no
               differences in liver function, COVID-19 disease severity, or
               outcomes between patients who previously received direct-acting
               antiviral therapy (and achieved sustained virological response)
               and patients who did not receive this therapy. CONCLUSION:
               Patients with liver cirrhosis are susceptible to higher severity
               and mortality if infected with COVID-19. Male gender, diabetes
               mellitus, and liver cirrhosis are independent factors associated

              CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc score systems on the prediction
              of mortality in the patients with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
              The data were collected from 508 hospitalized patients with
              COVID-19. Comorbidity features including coronary artery disease,
              peripheral arterial disease, congestive heart failure,
              hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus,
              hyperlipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
              cerebrovascular event, cancer status, and renal disease were
              recorded. The patients were divided as surviving group (n=440)
              and non-survivors (n=68). RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate
              of the patients with COVID-19 was 13.4\%. Factors found to be
              associated with mortality in univariate analysis were
              CHA2DS2-VASc, CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc, cancer state,
              atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, CRP, albumin
              and ferritin. Model 1 multivariate cox regression analysis
              revealed CHA2DS2-VASc, hemoglobin, CRP and ferritin levels to be
              independently associated with mortality. Factors that were found
              to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality in
              Model 2 analysis were CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc,
              hemoglobin, CRP and ferritin whereas except hemoglobin in Model 3
              analysis, the other variables had been the same. Predictive power
              of R2CHA2DS2-VASc was better than of both CHA2DS2-VASc (p=0.002)
              and CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (p=0.034) in determining the in-hospital
              mortality. Patients with higher R2CHA2DS2-VASc (> 3 points),
              CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (> 3 points) and CHA2DS2-VASc (> 2 points) scores
              exhibited the highest mortality rate in survival analysis by
              using Kaplan-Meier and long-rank tests. CONCLUSIONS:
              CHA2DS2-VASc, CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, and R2CHA2DS2-VASc were found to
              be independent predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19
              patients. The current study revealed that the predictive ability
              of R2CHA2DS2-VASc was better than the both of CHA2DS2-VASc and
              CHA2DS2-VASc-HS score.",

               delivered and experienced. METHODS: One-on-one interviews and a
               virtual ethnographic roundtable were conducted among 45
               patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in 4
               therapeutic areas from the United States and Japan: overactive
               bladder, vasomotor symptoms, prostate cancer, and metastatic
               urothelial carcinoma. The goal was to identify the impact of
               COVID-19 on patient/caregiver and HCP attitudes, interactions,
               beliefs, and behaviors toward the healthcare system and care
               pathway. RESULTS: Four foundational themes were identified: 1)
               COVID-19 risk is relative; 2) isolation is collateral damage; 3)
               telehealth is a parallel universe; and 4) COVID-19 is
               destabilizing the foundations of healthcare. Numerous insights,
               influenced by diverse cultural, social, and psychological
               factors, were identified within each theme. CONCLUSIONS: The
               impacts of COVID-19 were noticeable at multiple points of care
               during the ``universal'' care pathway, including at initial
               screening, referral to specialists, diagnosis, treatment
               initiation/surgery, and during ongoing care. Greater
               appreciation of the short- and long-term impacts of COVID-19 and

               diagnosed from February-July 2019 and 2020, focusing on the time
               duration for acceptance and time for oncologic treatment
               initiation. Eligibility and referral status were recorded.
               Clinical data of COVID-19-positive cancer patients were
               collected and evaluated their outcomes and survival. RESULTS:
               Data of 1574 cancer patients (mean age, 57.1 years) were
               collected. Mean time for acceptance was 7.3 days in 2019 and 8
               days in 2020, with no statistically significant difference. Mean
               time for oncology treatment initiation was 38.4 days in 2019 and
               44.3 days in 2020, with no statistically significant difference.
               The number of new cancer patients decreased in 2020 but
               increased in peripheral hospitals. It decreased in Riyadh and

               an era of renewed call for actions to identify sustainable

               care and health care delivery through physiological supportive

               central role in low-grade systemic inflammation-are associated

               2019 (COVID-19) display a distinct spectrum of disease severity
               yet the risk factors aren't well understood. We sought to

               progenitor cells in children and older patients. METHODS: We
               retrospectively analyzed clinical features in a cohort of 299
               patients with COVID-19. The expression and distribution of ACE2
               and lung progenitor cells were systematically examined using a
               combination of public single-cell RNA-seq data sets, lung
               biopsies, and ex vivo infection of lung tissues with SARS-CoV-2
               pseudovirus in children and older adults. We also followed up
               patients who had recovered from COVID-19. RESULTS: Compared with
               children, older patients (>50 years.) were more likely to
               develop into serious pneumonia with reduced lymphocytes and
               aberrant inflammatory response (P = .001). The expression level
               of ACE2 and lung progenitor cell markers were generally
               decreased in older patients. Notably, ACE2 positive cells were
               mainly distributed in the alveolar region, including SFTPC
               positive cells, but rarely in airway regions in the older adults
               (P < .01). The follow-up of discharged patients revealed a
               prolonged recovery from pneumonia in the older (P < .025).
               CONCLUSIONS: Compared to children, ACE2 positive cells are
               generally decreased in older adults and mainly presented in the
               lower pulmonary tract. The lung progenitor cells are also
               decreased. These risk factors may impact disease severity and

               associations between BMI and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis,
               hospitalization with COVID-19, and death after a COVID-19
               diagnosis or hospitalization (subsequent death), accounting for
               potential effect modification by age and sex. DESIGN:
               Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Primary care records
               covering >80\% of the Catalan population, linked to regionwide
               testing, hospital, and mortality records from March to May 2020.
               PARTICIPANTS: Adults ($\geq$18 years) with at least 1
               measurement of weight and height. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard
               ratios (HR) for each outcome. RESULTS: We included 2 524 926
               participants. After 67 days of follow-up, 57 443 individuals
               were diagnosed with COVID-19, 10 862 were hospitalized with
               COVID-19, and 2467 had a subsequent death. BMI was positively
               associated with being diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19.
               Compared to a BMI of 22 kg/m2, the HR (95\% CI) of a BMI of 31
               kg/m2 was 1.22 (1.19-1.24) for diagnosis and 1.88 (1.75-2.03)
               and 2.01 (1.86-2.18) for hospitalization without and with a
               prior outpatient diagnosis, respectively. The association
               between BMI and subsequent death was J-shaped, with a modestly
               higher risk of death among individuals with BMIs $\leq$ 19 kg/m2
               and a more pronounced increasing risk for BMIs $\geq$ 40 kg/m2.
               The increase in risk for COVID-19 outcomes was particularly
               pronounced among younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a
               monotonic association between BMI and COVID-19 diagnosis and
               hospitalization risks but a J-shaped relationship with
               mortality. More research is needed to unravel the mechanisms

               age and comorbidities. METHODS: Nationwide register-based
               follow-up study of COVID-19 patients in Denmark until 16 May
               2020. Average risk ratio comparing 30-day composite outcome of
               all-cause death, severe COVID-19 diagnosis or intensive care
               unit (ICU) admission for men versus women standardized to the
               age and comorbidity distribution of all patients were derived
               from multivariable Cox regression. Included covariates were age,

               with potential association with COVID-19. METHODS:
               Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in five MM data sets
               (GSE47552, GSE16558, GSE13591, GSE6477, and GSE39754) with the
               same expression trends were screened out. Functional enrichment
               analysis and the protein-protein interaction network were
               performed for all DEGs. Prognosis-associated DEGs were screened
               using the stepwise Cox regression analysis in the cancer genome
               atlas (TCGA) MMRF-CoMMpass cohort and the GSE24080 data set.
               Prognosis-associated DEGs associated with COVID-19 infection in
               the GSE164805 data set were also identified. RESULTS: A total of
               98 DEGs with the same expression trends in five data sets were
               identified, and 83 DEGs were included in the protein-protein

               were associated with MM prognosis in the TCGA cohort, and only
               the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C (COX6C) gene (HR = 1.717,

               with controls but were upregulated in patients with severe
               COVID-19 compared with patients with mild illness. CONCLUSIONS:
               The NOD2 and COX6C genes might be used as prognostic biomarkers

               presence of co-morbidities, especially cancer leading to
               elevated mortality rates. SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to alter
               immune system homeostasis. Whether cancer patients developing
               COVID-19 present alterations of immune functions which might
               contribute to worse outcomes have so far been poorly
               investigated. We conducted a multi-omic analysis of
               immunological parameters in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
               (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with and without cancer. Healthy
               donors and SARS-CoV-2-negative cancer patients were also
               included as controls. At the infection peak, cytokine multiplex
               analysis of blood samples, cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)
               cell population analyses, and Nanostring gene expression using
               Pancancer array on PBMCs were performed. We found that eight
               pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, IL-1ra, MIP-1a,
               IP-10) out of 27 analyzed serum cytokines were modulated in
               COVID-19 patients irrespective of cancer status. Diverse
               subpopulations of T lymphocytes such as CD8+T, CD4+T central
               memory, Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), natural killer
               (NK), and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells were reduced, while B
               plasmablasts were expanded in COVID-19 cancer patients. Our
               findings illustrate a repertoire of aberrant alterations of gene
               expression in circulating immune cells of COVID-19 cancer
               patients. A 19-gene expression signature of PBMCs is able to
               discriminate COVID-19 patients with and without solid cancers.
               Gene set enrichment analysis highlights an increased gene

               $\alpha$/$\beta$ response and signaling which paired with
               aberrant cell cycle regulation in cancer patients. Ten out of
               the 19 genes, validated in a real-world consecutive cohort, were

               the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of
               childhood cancer in Canada. We also aimed to compare the
               proportion of patients who enrolled in clinical trials at
               diagnosis, presented with metastatic disease or had an early
               death during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic
               compared with previous years. METHODS: We conducted an
               observational study that included children younger than 15 years
               with a new diagnosis of cancer between March 2016 and November
               2020 at 1 of 17 Canadian pediatric oncology centres. Our primary
               outcome was the monthly age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs)
               of cancers. We evaluated level and trend changes using
               interventional autoregressive integrated moving average models.
               Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients who were
               enrolled in a clinical trial, who had metastatic or advanced
               disease and who died within 30 days. We compared the baseline
               and pandemic periods using rate ratios (RRs) and 95\% confidence
               intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Age-standardized incidence rates
               during COVID-19 quarters were 157.7, 164.6, and 148.0 per
               million, respectively, whereas quarterly baseline ASIRs ranged
               between 150.3 and 175.1 per million (incidence RR 0.93 [95\% CI
               0.78 to 1.12] to incidence RR 1.04 [95\% CI 0.87 to 1.24]). We
               found no statistically significant level or slope changes
               between the projected and observed ASIRs for all new cancers
               (parameter estimate [$\beta$], level 4.98, 95\% CI -15.1 to
               25.04, p = 0.25), or when stratified by cancer type or by
               geographic area. Clinical trial enrolment rate was stable or
               increased during the pandemic compared with baseline (RR 1.22
               [95\% CI 0.70 to 2.13] to RR 1.71 [95\% CI 1.01 to 2.89]). There
               was no difference in the proportion of patients with metastatic
               disease (RR 0.84 [95\% CI 0.55 to 1.29] to RR 1.22 [0.84 to
               1.79]), or who died within 30 days (RR 0.16 [95\% CI 0.01 to
               3.04] to RR 1.73 [95\% CI 0.38 to 15.2]). INTERPRETATION: We did
               not observe a statistically significant change in the incidence
               of childhood cancer, or in the proportion of children enrolling
               in a clinical trial, presenting with metastatic disease or who

               hospitalized, and 60 (20.0\%) died. Age > 70 years was
               associated with severe/critical disease (p = 0.036) and
               mortality (p = 0.023), hypertension with severe/critical disease
               (p = 0.046) and hospitalization (p = 0.001), active
               haemato-oncological treatment with hospitalization (p = 0.009),
               and remdesivir treatment was associated with decreased mortality
               (p = 0.021). Convalescent plasma, enoxaparin, and
               corticosteroids resulted in no clinical benefit. In conclusion,
               COVID-19 infection seems particularly severe in patients with
               hematological malignancies, and of all examined therapies,
               remdesivir appears to be the most effective.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Patients treated with long-term opioid therapy (LTOT)
               are known to have compromised immune systems and respiratory
               function, both of which make them particularly susceptible to
               the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The objective of this study was to assess
               the risk of developing severe clinical outcomes among COVID-19
               non-cancer patients on LTOT, compared with those without LTOT.
               DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES: A retrospective cohort design using
               electronic health records in the TriNetX research database.
               PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 418 216 adults diagnosed with COVID-19
               in January-December 2020 from 51 US healthcare organisations:
               9558 in the LTOT and 408 658 in the control cohort. They did not
               have cancer diagnoses; only a small proportion might have been
               treated with opioid maintenance for opioid use disorder.
               RESULTS: Patient on LTOT had a higher risk ratio (RR) than
               control patients to visit an emergency department (RR 2.04, 95\%
               CI 1.93 to 2.16) and be hospitalised (RR 2.91, 95\% CI 2.69 to
               3.15). Once admitted, LTOT patients were more likely to require
               intensive care (RR 3.65, 95\% CI 3.10 to 4.29), mechanical
               ventilation (RR 3.47, 95\% CI 2.89 to 4.15) and vasopressor
               support (RR 5.28, 95\% CI 3.70 to 7.53) and die within 30 days
               (RR 1.96, 95\% CI 1.67 to 2.30). The LTOT group also showed
               increased risk (RRs from 2.06 to 3.98, all significant to 95\%
               CI) of more-severe infection (eg, cough, dyspnoea, fever,
               hypoxaemia, thrombocytopaenia and acute respiratory distress
               syndrome). Statistically significant differences in several
               laboratory results and other vital signs appeared clinically
               negligible. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients on LTOT were at higher
               risk of increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare
               utilisation. Interventions to reduce the need for LTOT and to
               increase compliance with COVID-19 protective measures may
               improve outcomes and reduce healthcare cost in this population.
               Prospective studies need to confirm and refine these findings.",

               COVID-19 convalescent patients confirmed from 1 January to 20
               March 2020 in Jiangsu, China and collected serum samples for
               testing IgM/IgG and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
               between 26 August and 28 October 2020. In total, 284 recovered
               participants with COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. Patients
               had a mean age of 46.72 years (standard deviation [SD], 17.09),
               and 138 (48.59\%) were male. The median follow-up time after
               symptom onset was 225.5 (interquartile range [IQR], 219 to 232)
               days. During the follow-up period (162 to 282 days after symptom
               onset), the seropositive rate of IgM fluctuated around 25.70\%
               (95\% confidence interval [CI], 20.72\% to 31.20\%) and that of
               IgG fluctuated around 79.93\% (95\% CI, 74.79\% to 84.43\%). Of
               the 284 patients, 64 participants were tested when discharged
               from hospital. Compared with that at the acute phase, the
               IgM/IgG antibody levels and IgM seropositivity have decreased;
               however, the seropositivity of IgG was not significantly lower
               at this follow-up (78.13\% versus 82.81\%). Fifty percent
               inhibitory dilution (ID50) titers of neutralizing antibody for
               samples when discharged from hospital (geometric mean titer
               [GMT], 82; 95\% CI, 56 to 121) were significantly higher than
               those at 6 to 7 months after discharge (GMT, 47; 95\% CI, 35 to
               63) (P < 0.001). After 7 months from symptom onset, the
               convalescent COVID-19 patients continued to have high IgG
               seropositive; however, many plasma samples decreased
               neutralizing activity. IMPORTANCE The long-term characteristics
               of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among COVID-19 patients remain
               largely unclear. Tracking the longevity of these antibodies can
               provide a forward-looking reference for monitoring COVID-19. We
               conducted a comprehensive assessment combining the kinetics of
               specific and neutralizing antibodies over 7 months with age and
               disease severity and revealed influencing factors of the
               protection period of convalescent patients. By observing the
               long-term antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and comparing
               antibody levels at two time points after symptom onset, we found
               that the convalescent COVID-19 patients continued to have a high
               IgG seropositive rate; however, their plasma samples decreased
               neutralizing activity. These findings provide evidence
               supporting that the neutralizing activity of SARS-CoV-2-infected
               persons should be monitored and the administration of vaccine
               may be needed.",

               have been associated with severe COVID-19 infection. However, in
               the literature to date, the cohorts described have typically
               included patients who were moderate to severely unwell with
               pneumonia and who required intensive care stay. It is uncertain
               if these markers apply to a population with less severe illness.
               We sought to describe the haematological profile of patients
               with mild disease with COVID-19 admitted to a single centre in
               Singapore. METHODS: We examined 554 consecutive PCR positive
               SARS-COV-2 patients admitted to a single tertiary healthcare
               institution from Feb 2020 to April 2020. In all patients a full
               blood count was obtained within 24 h of presentation. RESULTS:
               Patients with pneumonia had higher neutrophil percentages (66.5
               $\pm$ 11.6 vs 55.2 $\pm$ 12.6\%, p < 0.001), lower absolute
               lymphocyte count (1.5 $\pm$ 1.1 vs 1.9 $\pm$ 2.1 x109/L, p <
               0.011) and absolute eosinophil count (0.2 $\pm$ 0.9 vs 0.7 $\pm$
               1.8 $\times$ 109/L, p = 0.002). Platelet counts (210 $\pm$ 56 vs
               230 $\pm$ 61, p = 0.020) were slightly lower in the group with
               pneumonia. We did not demonstrate significant differences in the
               neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio and
               platelet-lymphocyte ratio in patients with or without pneumonia.
               Sixty-eight patients (12.3\%) had peripheral eosinophilia. This
               was more common in migrant workers living in dormitories.
               CONCLUSION: Neutrophilia and lymphopenia were found to be
               markers associated with severe COVID-19 illness. We did not find
               that combined haematological parameters: neutrophil-lymphocyte
               ratio, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio,

               outcomes of asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 among patients
               with cancer. Detection of asymptomatic carriers is important in
               this population given the use of myelosuppressive and
               immunomodulating therapies. Understanding the asymptomatic
               carrier rate will help to develop mitigation strategies in this
               high-risk cohort. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of an
               asymptomatic screening protocol which required patients
               receiving infusional anti-cancer therapy to undergo a
               symptom/exposure screen and SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing 24-96 h prior
               to their infusion. The primary outcome of this analysis was the
               rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes
               included the rate of COVID-19-related hospitalization and
               mortality and delays in oncologic therapy. RESULTS: Among a
               cohort of 2691 cancer patients who underwent asymptomatic
               screening, 1.6\% (N = 43/2691) of patients were found to be
               SARS-CoV-2 positive on asymptomatic screening. 11.6\% (N = 5/43)
               of the cohort ultimately developed COVID-19-related symptoms.
               Four patients required hospitalization for complications of
               COVID-19 infection. No patient died from COVID-related
               complications. 97.7\% (N = 42/43) had their anti-cancer therapy
               delayed or deferred with a median delay of 21 days (range: 7-77
               days). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, among a cohort of active cancer
               patients receiving anti-cancer therapy, an asymptomatic
               SARS-CoV2 PCR-based screening protocol detected a small cohort
               of asymptomatic carriers. The majority of these patients
               remained asymptomatic on long-term follow-up and outcomes were
               much more favorable compared to previously described outcomes of

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
               continue to spread around the world even one year after the
               declaration of a global pandemic. Those with weakened immune
               systems, due to immunosuppressive medications or disease, may be
               at higher risk of COVID-19. This includes individuals with
               autoimmune diseases, cancer, transplants, and dialysis patients.
               Assessing the risk and outcomes of COVID-19 in this population
               has been challenging. While administrative databases provide
               data with minimal selection and recall bias, clinical and
               behavioral data is lacking. To address this, we are collecting
               self-reported survey data from a randomly selected subsample
               with and without COVID-19, which will be linked to
               administrative health data, to better quantify the risk of
               COVID-19 infection associated with immunosuppression. METHODS
               AND ANALYSIS: Using administrative and laboratory data from
               British Columbia (BC), Canada, we established a population-based
               case-control study of all individuals who tested positive for
               SARS-CoV-2. Each case was matched to 40 randomly selected
               individuals from two control groups: individuals who tested
               negative for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., negative controls) and untested
               individuals from the general population (i.e., untested
               controls). We will contact 1000 individuals from each group to
               complete a survey co-designed with patient partners. A
               conditional logistic regression model will adjust for potential
               confounders and effect modifiers. We will examine the odds of
               COVID-19 infection according to immunosuppressive medication or
               disease type. To adjust for relevant confounders and effect
               modifiers not available in administrative data, the survey will
               include questions on behavioural variables that influence
               probability of being tested, acquiring COVID-19, and
               experiencing severe outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This
               study has received approval from the University of British
               Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board [H20-01914]. Findings
               will be disseminated through scientific conferences, open access

               lower seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination possibly related
               to myelo-immunosuppressive therapies. We conducted a prospective
               study to assess factors predicting poor seroconversion and
               adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) to the BNT162b2
               vaccine in patients on active treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
               Cancer patients, candidates to two doses of BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2
               vaccination, were enrolled. Patients on active surveillance
               served as controls. The primary endpoint was poor seroconversion
               (anti S1/S2 IgG < 25 AU/mL) after 21 days from the second dose.
               RESULTS: Between March and July 2021, 320 subjects were
               recruited, and 291 were assessable. The lack of seroconversion
               at 21 days from the second dose was 1.6\% (95\% CI, 0.4-8.7) on
               active surveillance, 13.9\% (8.2-21.6) on chemotherapy, 11.4\%
               (5.1-21.3) on hormone therapy, 21.7\% (7.5-43.7) on targeted
               therapy and 4.8\% (0.12-23.8) on immune-checkpoint-inhibitors
               (ICI). Compared to controls, the risk of no IgG response was
               greater for chemotherapy (p = 0.033), targeted therapy (0.005)
               and hormonotherapy (p = 0.051). Lymphocyte count < 1 $\times$
               109/L (p = 0.04) and older age (p = 0.03) also significantly
               predicted poor seroconversion. Overall, 43 patients (14.8\%)
               complained of AEFI, mostly of mild grade. Risk of AEFI was
               greater in females (p = 0.001) and younger patients (p = 0.009).
               CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone therapy,
               lymphocyte count < 1 $\times$ 109/L, and increasing age predict
               poor seroconversion after two doses of BNT162b2 in up to 20\% of
               patients, indicating the need for a third dose and long-term
               serological testing in non-responders. AEFI occur much more
               frequently in women and younger subjects who may benefit from
               preventive medications. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER:

               acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
               The production is regulated by the androgen receptor (AR). It is
               speculated that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may protect
               patients affected by prostate cancer (PC) from SARS-CoV-2
               infection. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients
               treated for COVID-19 in our institution who had a previous
               diagnosis of PC. We analyzed the influence of exposure of ADT on
               the presence of severe course of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of
               2280 patients were treated in our center for COVID-19 with a
               worse course of disease in males (higher rates of
               hospitalization, intense care unit [ICU] admission, and death).
               Out of 1349 subjects registered in our PC database, 156 were on
               ADT and 1193 were not. Out of those, 61 (4.52\%) PC patients
               suffered from COVID-19, 11 (18.0\%) belonged to the ADT group,
               and 50 (82.0\%) to the non-ADT group. Regarding the influence of
               ADT on the course of the disease, statistically significant
               differences were found neither in the death rate (27.3\% vs.
               34\%; p = 0.481), nor in the presence of severe COVID-19: need
               for intubation or ICU admission (0\% vs. 6.3\%; p = 0.561) and
               need for corticoid treatment, interferon beta, or tocilizumab
               (60\% vs. 34.7\%; p = 0.128). Multivariate analysis adjusted for
               clinically relevant comorbidities did not find that ADT was a
               protective factor for worse clinical evolution (risk ratio [RR]
               1.08; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.83; p = 0.77) or
               death (RR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.26-1.74; p = 0.41). CONCLUSIONS: Our
               study confirms that COVID-19 is more severe in men. However, the

               response, predictive markers, and safety of BNT162b2 in
               haemato-oncological patients. A total of 259 haemato-oncological

               vaccination, and at 3 and 7 weeks after the first dose (T1, T2).
               Safety assessment was performed. At T2 spike protein receptor
               binding domain (S/RBD) antibodies were detected in 71·4\% of
               haematological and in 94·5\% of oncological patients (P <

               interval 3·2-63·3, P = 0·001). Subgroups of patients with
               lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were at highest risk
               of serological non-response. Low immunoglobulin G (IgG) level,

               significantly associated with poor serological response (P <
               0·05). Vaccination was well tolerated with only 2·7\% of
               patients reporting severe side-effects. Patients with
               side-effects developed a higher S/RBD-antibody titre compared to
               patients without side-effects (P = 0·038). Haematological
               patients under treatment were at highest risk of serological
               non-response. Low lymphocytes, NK cells and IgG levels were
               found to be associated with serological non-response.
               Serological response in oncological patients was encouraging.

               CONCLUSIONS: The immune landscape in COVID-19 patients was
               noticeably different between the sexes, and these differences
               may highlight disease vulnerability in males. This study
               suggested that certain treatments that increase or decrease the
               immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 might be necessary for male and
               female patients at certain disease stages.",

               particularly vulnerable to the deleterious consequences of
               lockdown and social distancing. The psychosocial effects of the
               COVID-19 pandemic on this group are still unknown, and we want
               to explore how their quality of life (QoL) has changed in this
               unique situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey,
               composed of pandemic-specific items, plus the EORTC QLQ-C30, was
               administered to a cohort of HNC survivors. Using previously
               published reference values as a control group, we have evaluated
               the impact of the pandemic on their QoL. We have also explored
               the differences between those who had received a total
               laryngectomy (LP, laryngectomized population) vs other HNC
               patients, in order to assess the role of tracheostomy in this
               regard. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one HNC patients
               completed the survey. The scores of the physical (80.5 vs 85, p
               = 0.028), role (78 vs 84, p = 0.030), and emotional functioning
               (76 vs 81, p = 0.041) were significantly different in the two
               groups, with worse functioning in our patients. Comparing LP
               with the other HNC patients, social (76.6 vs 88.9, p = 0.008)
               and physical functioning (75.5 vs 86.1, p = 0.006) were
               significantly worse in the former group. LP also reported a
               greater perception that others are afraid to be close to them
               (1.67 vs 1.32, p = 0.020). No differences were found between LP
               with and without voice prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show
               how HNC patients are at high risk for a worsening in QoL because

               damage and the clinical severity of COVID-19 (refs. 1-4). Here
               we show that SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, evokes cellular
               senescence as a primary stress response in infected cells.
               Virus-induced senescence (VIS) is indistinguishable from other
               forms of cellular senescence and is accompanied by a
               senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which
               comprises pro-inflammatory cytokines,
               extracellular-matrix-active factors and pro-coagulatory
               mediators5-7. Patients with COVID-19 displayed markers of
               senescence in their airway mucosa in situ and increased serum
               levels of SASP factors. In vitro assays demonstrated macrophage
               activation with SASP-reminiscent secretion, complement lysis and
               SASP-amplifying secondary senescence of endothelial cells, which
               mirrored hallmark features of COVID-19 such as macrophage and
               neutrophil infiltration, endothelial damage and widespread
               thrombosis in affected lung tissue1,8,9. Moreover, supernatant

               navitoclax and a combination of dasatinib plus quercetin
               selectively eliminated VIS cells, mitigated COVID-19-reminiscent

               This study aimed to evaluate the short-term impact of the
               pandemic on the surgical treatment of patients with gastric
               cancer (GC) in addition to their clinicopathological
               characteristics. We also verified adherence to the COVID-19
               screening protocol adopted in the institution. METHODS: All
               patients with GC who underwent surgical treatment between 2015
               and 2021 were retrospectively evaluated and divided into two
               groups according to the time period: control group (2015-2019)
               and COVID group (2020-2021). The institutional protocol
               recommends that patients referred for surgery undergo RT-PCR for
               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.
               RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were classified into the COVID
               group and 535 into the control group. The number of surgical
               procedures performed in the control group was 107 (SD$\pm$23.8)
               per year. Diagnostic procedures (p=0.005), preoperative
               chemotherapy (p<0.001), and adenocarcinomas without Lauren's
               subtype (p=0.009) were more frequent in the COVID group than in
               the control group. No significant difference was observed in the
               pathological characteristics and surgical outcomes of curative
               GC between the two groups. Evaluation of protocol compliance
               showed that of 83 patients with GC in the COVID group, 19
               (22.9\%) were not tested for COVID-19 before surgery. Two
               patients tested positive for COVID-19 (one preoperative and one
               postoperative). CONCLUSION: A decrease in the average number of
               surgeries and a higher frequency of diagnostic procedures
               occurred during the pandemic than in the previous time period.
               Tumor/node/metastasis classification, morbidity rates, and
               mortality rates in patients with GC during the pandemic did not
               differ from those in the previous time period. Accordingly, GC
               surgical treatment with acceptable screening protocol compliance
               could be safely performed during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

               clinical evaluation or admission and tested by quantitative mass
               spectrometry to characterize metabolic profiles using selected
               metabolites. The findings in COVID-19 (+) patients reveal
               changes in the concentrations of glutamate, valeryl-carnitine,

               clinical, demographic, and laboratory features and treatments
               provided were studied, and their effect on mortality rates was
               analyzed. In our study the median age of the patients was 67
               years, and 55.4\% were male. More than half (56.5\%) of our
               patients had metastasis. The mortality rate was 6.2\% in the
               overall population with COVID-19, whereas it was 23.9\% in
               patients with cancer. The mortality rate in patients with
               metastasis was statistically significantly higher compared with
               those without metastasis (34.0\% vs. 10.3\% P = 0.008). The
               mortality rate in patients still smoking was statistically
               significantly higher than in non-smokers (37.5\% vs. 12.5\% P =

               C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
               and D-dimer levels were statistically significantly higher than
               in those without, and the mortality rates of patients with lower

               medical authorities and policy makers to optimize health care
               globally. A major lesson is that resilient health systems should
               absorb sudden shocks incited by overwhelming health emergencies
               without compromising the continuum of care of chronic diseases,
               especially of cancer. METHODS: The present review dissects the
               association between COVID-19 and thyroid cancer (TC), especially
               with differentiated TC (DTC), focusing on available data,
               knowledge gaps, current challenges, and future perspectives.
               RESULTS: Obesity has been incriminated in terms of both COVID-19
               severity and a rising incidence of TC, especially of DTC. The
               current conceptualization of the pathophysiological landscape of
               COVID-19-(D)TC association implicates an interplay between
               obesity, inflammation, immunity, and oxidative stress. Whether
               COVID-19 could aggravate the health burden posed by (D)TC or
               vice versa has yet to be clarified. Improved understanding and
               harnessing of the pathophysiological landscape of the

               patient's body is associated with severe forms of disease. It is
               one of the main complications of coronavirus disease-2019
               (COVID-19), in which immune cells play a major role. Studies
               have shown immune cells in the tumor environment can be
               effective to induce resistance to chemotherapy in cancer
               patients. RESULT: Therefore, considering the role of immune
               cells to induce cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, and their
               role to cause resistance to chemotherapy, they are effective on
               disease progression and creation of severe form of disease.

               also studied the impact on subsequent cancer treatment in those
               with COVID-19. METHODS: All patients who underwent elective and
               emergency cancer surgery from April to September 2020 were
               included. After screening for symptoms, a preoperative test was
               performed from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs before the
               procedure. Patients were followed up for 30 days postoperatively
               and complications were noted. RESULTS: 2108 asymptomatic
               patients were tested, of which 200 (9.5\%) tested positive. Of
               those who tested positive, 140 (70\%) underwent the planned
               surgery at a median of 30 days from testing positive, and 20
               (14.3\%) had $\geq$ Grade III complications. Forty (20\%)

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Nonthyroidal Illness Syndrome (NTIS) can be detected
               in many critical illnesses. Recently, we demonstrated that this
               condition is frequently observed in COVID-19 patients too and it
               is correlated with the severity the disease. However, the exact
               mechanism through which thyroid hormones influence the course of
               COVID-19, as well as that of many other critical illnesses, is
               not clear yet and treatment with T4, T3 or a combination of both
               is still controversial. Aim of this study was to analyze body
               composition in COVID-19 patients in search of possible
               correlation with the thyroid function. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
               report here our experience performed in 74 critically ill
               COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU)
               of our University Hospital in Rome. In these patients, we
               evaluated the thyroid hormone function and body composition by
               Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) during the acute phase of
               the disease at admission in the ICU. To examine the effects of
               thyroid function on BIA parameters we analyzed also 96
               outpatients, affected by thyroid diseases in different
               functional conditions. We demonstrated that COVID-19 patients
               with low FT3 serum values exhibited increased values of the
               Total Body Water/Free Fat Mass (TBW/FFM) ratio. Patients with
               the lowest FT3 serum values had also the highest level of
               TBW/FFM ratio. This ratio is an indicator of the fraction of FFM
               as water and represents one of the best-known body-composition
               constants in mammals. We found an inverse correlation between
               FT3 serum values and this constant. Reduced FT3 serum values in
               COVID-19 patients were correlated with the increase in the total
               body water (TBW), the extracellular water (ECW) and the
               sodium/potassium exchangeable ratio (Nae:Ke), and with the
               reduction of the intracellular water (ICW). No specific
               correlation was observed in thyroid patients at different
               functional conditions between any BIA parameters and FT3 serum
               values, except for the patient with myxedema, that showed a
               picture similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients with NTIS.
               Since the Na+/K+ pump is a well-known T3 target, we measured the
               mRNA expression levels of the two genes coding for the two major
               isoforms of this pump. We demonstrated that COVID-19 patients
               with NTIS had lower levels of mRNA of both genes in the
               peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)s obtained from our
               patients during the acute phase of the disease. In addition, we
               retrieved data from transcriptome analysis, performed on
               human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
               (hiPSC-CM)s treated with T3 and we demonstrated that in these
               cells T3 is able to stimulate the expression of these two genes
               in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we
               demonstrated that measurement of BIA parameters is a useful
               method to analyze water and salt retention in COVID-19 patients
               hospitalized in ICU and, in particular, in those that develop
               NTIS. Our results indicate that NTIS has peculiar similarities
               with myxedema seen in severe hypothyroid patients, albeit it
               occurs more rapidly. The Na+/K+ pump is a possible target of T3
               action, involved in the pathogenesis of the anasarcatic
               condition observed in our COVID-19 patients with NTIS. Finally,
               measurement of BIA parameters may represent good endpoints to
               evaluate the benefit of future clinical interventional trials,
               based on the administration of T3 in patients with NTIS.",

               accuracy of the presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) on baseline
               electrocardiogram on the adverse outcome in critical patients
               with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with cardiovascular
               disease (CVD). METHODS: The current study was retrospective
               designed and included 169 patients who were critically ill with
               COVID-19 and CVD (mean age of 62$\pm$15 years). The patients
               were grouped into those who died (non-survivor group) and those
               who survived (survivor group). RESULTS: The non-survivors were
               older and more often had CVD (p=0.009), hypertension (p=0.046),
               diabetes (p=0.048), cancer (p=0.023), and chronic renal failure
               (p=0.001). Although the presence of fQRS on the basal
               electrocardiogram was more common in patients who died, this was
               not statistically significant (p=0.059). Furthermore,
               non-survivors had more frequent the coexistence of CVD and fQRS
               (p=0.029). In Model 1 multivariate regression analysis, CVD
               alone was not a predictor of mortality (p=0.078), whereas
               coexistence of CVD and fQRS was found to be an independent
               predictor of mortality in Model 2 analysis [hazard ratio (HR):
               2.243; p=0.003]. Furthermore, older age (HR: 1.022; p=0.006 and
               HR: 1.023; p=0.005), cancer (HR: 1.912; p=0.021 and HR: 1.858;
               p=0.031), high SOFA score (HR: 1.177; p=0.003 and HR: 1.215;
               p<0.001), and increased CRP level (HR: 1.003; p=0.039 and HR:
               1.003; p=0.027) independently predicted the mortality in both
               multivariate analysis models, respectively. CONCLUSION: fQRS may
               be a useful and handy risk-stratification tool for clinical
               outcomes by identifying high-risk individuals, especially among
               those with CVD.",

               lung cancer are a vulnerable population throughout the pandemic.
               Limited information is available in Latin America regarding the
               impact of the pandemic on medical care. The goal of this study
               was to describe the clinical and social effect of COVID-19 on
               patients with thoracic cancer and to ascertain outcomes in those
               with a confirmed diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort
               study included patients with thoracic neoplasms within a single
               institution between March 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021. All
               variables of interest were extracted from electronic medical
               records. During this period, the Depression Anxiety and Stress
               Scale 21 (DASS-2) was applied to evaluate and identify more
               common psychological disorders. RESULTS: The mean age for the
               total cohort (n = 548) was 61.5 $\pm$ 12.9 years; non-small cell
               lung cancer was the most frequent neoplasm (86.9\%), advanced
               stages predominated (80\%), and most patients were under active
               therapy (82.8\%). Any change in treatment was reported in 23.9\%
               of patients, of which 78.6\% were due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
               Treatment delays ($\geq$7 days) were the most frequent
               modifications in 41.9\% of cases, followed by treatment
               suspension at 37.4\%. Patients without treatment changes had a
               more prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival
               (hazard ratio [HR] 0.21, p < .001 and HR 0.28, p < .001,
               respectively). The mean DASS-21 score was 10.45 in 144 evaluated
               patients, with women being more affected than men (11.41 vs.
               9.08, p < .001). Anxiety was reported in 30.5\% of cases,
               followed by depression and distress in equal proportions (18\%).
               Depressed and stressed patients had higher odds of experiencing
               delays in treatment than patients without depression (odds ratio
               [OR] 4.5, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.53-13.23, p = .006 and
               OR 3.18, 95\% CI 1.2-10.06, p = .006, respectively). CONCLUSION:
               Treatment adjustments in patients with thoracic malignancies
               often occurred to avoid COVID-19 contagion with detrimental
               effects on survival. Psychological disorders could have a role
               in adherence to the original treatment regimen. IMPLICATIONS FOR
               PRACTICE: The pandemic has placed an enormous strain on health
               care systems globally. Patients with thoracic cancers represent
               a vulnerable population, with increased morbidity and mortality
               rates. In Mexico, treatment modifications were common during the
               pandemic, and those who experienced delays had worse survival
               outcomes. Most treatment modifications were related to a patient
               decision rather than a lockdown of health care facilities in
               which mental health impairment plays an essential role.
               Moreover, the high case fatality rate highlights the importance
               of improving medical care access. Likewise, to develop
               strategies facing future threats that may compromise health care

               inflammation. To gain deeper insight into the molecular
               mechanisms behind ALI and to identify core elements of the
               regulatory network associated with this pathology, key genes
               involved in the regulation of the acute lung inflammatory
               response (Il6, Ccl2, Cat, Serpine1, Eln, Timp1, Ptx3, Socs3)
               were revealed using comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of
               whole-genome microarray datasets, functional annotation of
               differentially expressed genes (DEGs), reconstruction of
               protein-protein interaction networks and text mining. The
               bioinformatics data were validated using a murine model of
               LPS-induced ALI; changes in the gene expression patterns were
               assessed during ALI progression and prevention by
               anti-inflammatory therapy with dexamethasone and the
               semisynthetic triterpenoid soloxolone methyl (SM), two agents
               with different mechanisms of action. Analysis showed that 7 of 8
               revealed ALI-related genes were susceptible to LPS challenge
               (up-regulation: Il6, Ccl2, Cat, Serpine1, Eln, Timp1, Socs3;
               down-regulation: Cat) and their expression was reversed by the
               pre-treatment of mice with both anti-inflammatory agents.
               Furthermore, ALI-associated nodal genes were analysed with
               respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection and lung cancers. The overlap
               with DEGs identified in postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19
               patients revealed genes (Saa1, Rsad2, Ifi44, Rtp4, Mmp8) that
               (a) showed a high degree centrality in the COVID-19-related
               regulatory network, (b) were up-regulated in murine lungs after
               LPS administration, and (c) were susceptible to
               anti-inflammatory therapy. Analysis of ALI-associated key genes
               using The Cancer Genome Atlas showed their correlation with poor
               survival in patients with lung neoplasias (Ptx3, Timp1,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Despite the abundance of clinical data available for
               Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), little research on the
               psychological well-being of breast cancer survivors has been
               published. We investigate the extent to which self-compassion
               accounted for the association between psychological well-being
               (depression, anxiety) and death anxiety in breast cancer
               survivors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was applied.
               Participants were recruited from three departments of oncology
               in Zanjan, Iran. Data were collected from 210 breast cancer
               patients. Participants completed self-report measures. Pearson
               correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship
               among the study variables. Bootstrapping analyses were used to
               test the significance of indirect effects. RESULTS:
               Correlational analyses revealed that depression and anxiety were
               significantly and positively related to death anxiety (r = 0.77,
               p < 0.01; r = 0.85, p < 0.01, respectively) and negatively to
               self-compassion (r = - 0.48, p < 0.01; r = - 0.53, p < 0.01,

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Over 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been
               already administered across the United States, the United
               Kingdom and the European Union at the time of writing.
               Furthermore, 1.82 million booster doses have been administered
               in the US since 13th August, and similar booster programmes are
               currently planned or under consideration in the UK and the EU
               beginning in the autumn of 2021. Early reports showed an
               association between vaccine administration and the development
               of ipsilateral axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy,
               which could interfere with the diagnosis, treatment and
               follow-up of breast cancer patients. In this paper, we review
               the available evidence on vaccine-related lymphadenopathy, and
               we discuss the clinical implications of the same on breast
               cancer diagnosis and management. METHODS: A literature search
               was performed - PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, CINHAL, Springer
               Nature, ScienceDirect, Academic Search Premier and the Directory
               of Open Access Journals were searched for articles reporting on
               regional palpable or image-detected lymphadenopathy following
               COVID-19 vaccination. Separately, we compiled a series of case
               studies from the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton,
               United Kingdom and the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, United States
               of America, to illustrate the impact that regional
               lymphadenopathy post-COVID-19 vaccination can have on the
               diagnosis and management of patients being seen in diagnostic
               and therapeutic breast clinics. RESULTS: From the literature
               search, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 2057
               patients, 737 with lymphadenopathy). The incidence of
               lymphadenopathy ranged between 14.5\% and 53\% and persisted for
               >6 weeks in 29\% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians managing
               breast cancer patients should be aware that the COVID-19
               vaccination may result in regional lymphadenopathy in a
               significant number of patients, which can result in unnecessary
               investigations, treatment and increased patient anxiety. An
               accurate COVID-19 vaccination history should be collected from
               all patients where regional lymphadenopathy is a clinical and/or
               an imaging finding and then combined with clinical judgement
               when managing individual cases.",

               a sequential evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in
               convalescent patients with a median follow-up of 14 months
               (range 12.4-15.4) post first symptom onset. We report
               persistence of antibodies for all four specificities tested
               [Spike, Spike Receptor Binding Domain (Spike-RBD), Nucleocapsid,
               Nucleocapsid RNA Binding Domain (N-RBD)]. Anti-Spike antibodies
               persist better than anti-Nucleocapsid antibodies. The durability
               analysis supports a bi-phasic antibody decay with longer
               half-lives of antibodies after 6 months and antibody persistence
               for up to 14 months. Patients infected with the Wuhan (WA1)
               strain maintained strong cross-reactive recognition of Alpha and
               Delta Spike-RBD but significantly reduced binding to Beta and Mu
               Spike-RBD. Sixty percent of convalescent patients with
               detectable WA1-specific NAb also showed strong neutralization of
               the Delta variant, the prevalent strain of the present pandemic.
               These data show that convalescent patients maintain functional
               antibody responses for more than one year after infection,
               suggesting a strong long-lasting response after symptomatic
               disease that may offer a prolonged protection against
               re-infection. One patient from this cohort showed strong
               increase of both Spike and Nucleocapsid antibodies at 14 months
               post-infection indicating SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. These
               antibodies showed stronger cross-reactivity to a panel of
               Spike-RBD including Beta, Delta and Mu and neutralization of a
               panel of Spike variants including Beta and Gamma. This patient
               provides an example of strong anti-Spike recall immunity able to
               control infection at an asymptomatic level. Together, the
               antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients persist over 14
               months and continue to maintain cross-reactivity to the current
               variants of concern and show strong functional properties.",

               including risks of severe secondary infections. METHODS: Based
               on 445,845 UK Biobank participants registered in England, we
               conducted a matched cohort study where 5151 individuals with a
               positive test result or hospitalized with a diagnosis of
               COVID-19 were included in the exposed group. We then randomly
               selected up to 10 matched individuals without COVID-19 diagnosis
               for each exposed individual (n = 51,402). The life-threatening
               secondary infections were defined as diagnoses of severe
               secondary infections with high mortality rates (i.e., sepsis,
               endocarditis, and central nervous system infections) from the UK
               Biobank inpatient hospital data, or deaths from these infections
               from mortality data. The follow-up period was limited to 3
               months after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Using a similar
               study design, we additionally constructed a matched cohort where
               exposed individuals were diagnosed with seasonal influenza from
               either inpatient hospital or primary care data between 2010 and
               2019 (6169 exposed and 61,555 unexposed individuals). After
               controlling for multiple confounders, Cox models were used to
               estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of life-threatening secondary
               infections after COVID-19 or seasonal influenza. RESULTS: In the
               matched cohort for COVID-19, 50.22\% of participants were male,
               and the median age at the index date was 66 years. During a
               median follow-up of 12.71 weeks, the incidence rate of
               life-threatening secondary infections was 2.23 (123/55.15) and
               0.25 (151/600.55) per 1000 person-weeks for all patients with
               COVID-19 and their matched individuals, respectively, which
               corresponded to a fully adjusted HR of 8.19 (95\% confidence
               interval [CI] 6.33-10.59). The corresponding HR of
               life-threatening secondary infections among all patients with
               seasonal influenza diagnosis was 4.50, 95\% CI 3.34-6.08 (p for
               difference < 0.01). Also, elevated HRs were observed among
               hospitalized individuals for life-threatening secondary
               infections following hospital discharge, both in the COVID-19
               (HR = 6.28 [95\% CI 4.05-9.75]) and seasonal influenza (6.01
               [95\% CI 3.53-10.26], p for difference = 0.902) cohorts.
               CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients have increased subsequent risks of
               life-threatening secondary infections, to an equal extent or

               improving access; monitoring health status, health behaviors,
               and symptom management; enhancing information exchange; and
               mitigating the costs of care delivery, especially since the
               COVID-19 pandemic. To inform guidance for the use of
               telemedicine in the post-COVID era, the aim of this overview of
               systematic reviews (SRs) was to evaluate the efficacy of, and
               survivor engagement in, telemedicine interventions in the
               post-treatment survivorship phase, and to consider
               implementation barriers and facilitators. METHODS: PubMed,
               Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science databases
               were searched. SRs that examined the use of telemedicine in the
               post-treatment phase of cancer survivorship, published between
               January 2010 and April 2021, were included. Efficacy data were
               synthesized narratively. Implementation barriers and
               facilitators were synthesized using the Consolidated Framework
               for Implementation Research. RESULTS: Twenty-nine SRs were

               benefit the management of psychosocial and physical effects,
               particularly for improving fatigue and cognitive function. There

               current studies report contradictory results. Here, we examine
               potential confounders in COVID-19 respiratory microbiome studies
               by analyzing the upper (n = 58) and lower (n = 35) respiratory
               tract microbiome in well-phenotyped COVID-19 patients and
               controls combining microbiome sequencing, viral load
               determination, and immunoprofiling. We find that time in the
               intensive care unit and type of oxygen support, as well as
               associated treatments such as antibiotic usage, explain the most
               variation within the upper respiratory tract microbiome, while
               SARS-CoV-2 viral load has a reduced impact. Specifically,
               mechanical ventilation is linked to altered community structure
               and significant shifts in oral taxa previously associated with
               COVID-19. Single-cell transcriptomics of the lower respiratory
               tract of COVID-19 patients identifies specific oral bacteria in
               physical association with proinflammatory immune cells, which
               show higher levels of inflammatory markers. Overall, our
               findings suggest confounders are driving contradictory results
               in current COVID-19 microbiome studies and careful attention
               needs to be paid to ICU stay and type of oxygen support, as

               clinical utility of FDG PET/CT in patients with
               laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a single
               institution retrospective review of patients diagnosed with
               COVID-19 using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
               reaction (RT-PCR) who underwent FDG PET/CT for routine cancer
               care between March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020, during the height
               of the pandemic in New York City, New York, United States.
               PET/CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for imaging findings
               suspicious for COVID-19. For positive scans, PET and CT findings
               were recorded, including location, FDG avidity (SUVmax) and CT
               morphology. Patient demographics and COVID-19 specific clinical
               data were collected and analyzed with respect to PET/CT scan
               positivity, lung SUVmax, and time interval between PET/CT and
               RT-PCR. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (21 males and 10 females,
               mean age 57 years $\pm$ 16) were evaluated. Thirteen of 31
               patients had positive PET/CT scans, yielding a detection rate of
               41.9\%. Patients with positive scans had significantly higher
               rates of symptomatic COVID-19 infection (77\% vs 28\%, p = 0.01)
               and hospitalizations (46\% vs. 0\%, p = 0.002) compared to
               patients with negative scans. Eleven of 13 patients (84.6\%)
               with positive scans had FDG-avid lung findings, with mean lung
               SUVmax of 5.36. Six of 13 patients (46.2\%) had extrapulmonary
               findings of FDG-avid thoracic lymph nodes. The detection rate
               was significantly lower when the scan was performed before
               RT-PCR versus after RT-PCR (18.8\% (n = 3/16) vs. 66.7\% (n =
               10/15), p = 0.009). Lung SUVmax was not associated with COVID-19
               symptoms, severity, or disease course. CONCLUSION: FDG PET/CT
               has limited sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 infection.
               However, a positive PET scan is associated with higher risk of
               symptomatic infection and hospitalizations, which may be helpful
               in predicting disease severity.",

               lacking regarding the impact of pre-existing liver damage and
               neoplasia on SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome and vice-versa. This
               study aimed to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on
               hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C virus
               (HCV) infected patients, both in therapeutic-na{\"\i}ve and
               patients treated with direct acting antivirals. PATIENTS AND
               METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 21
               patients with a personal history of HCV infection, that have
               been diagnosed with different forms of HCC and who were
               subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were monitored
               by liver function tests, tumoral markers, blood cell count, and
               coagulation profile periodically. RESULTS: Solitary HCC nodules
               were predominant among the subjects who achieved sustained
               virologic response, while multinodular and infiltrative patterns
               were mostly prevalent among the treatment-na{\"\i}ve group. Most
               patients had mild and moderate COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSION:
               Within the current global pandemic crisis, cancer patients are
               highly vulnerable and in need of constant monitoring. Among
               patients with HCC, the ones with cured HCV infection may be at a
               lower risk of fatality than those with active HCV infection,

              suspected cancer referral (2-week wait [2WW]) between practices.
              AIM: To examine the change in use of 2WW referrals in England
              over 10 years (2009/2010 to 2018/2019) and the practice and
              population factors associated with cancer detection. DESIGN AND
              SETTING: Retrospective cross-sectional study of English general
              practices and their 2WW referral and Cancer Waiting Times
              database detection data (all cancers other than non-melanoma skin
              cancers) from 2009/2010 to 2018/2019. METHOD: A retrospective
              study conducted using descriptive statistics of changes over 10
              years in 2WW referral data. Yearly linear regression models were
              used to determine the association between cancer detection rates
              and quintiles of practice and population characteristics.
              Predicted cancer detection rates were calculated, as well as the
              difference between lowest to highest quintiles. RESULTS: Over the
              10 years studied there were 14.89 million 2WW referrals (2.24
              million in 2018/2019), and 2.68 million new cancer diagnoses, of
              which 1.26 million were detected following 2WW. The detection
              rate increased from 41\% to 52\% over the time period. In
              2018/2019 an additional 66 172 cancers were detected via 2WW
              compared with 2009/2010. Higher cancer detection via 2WW
              referrals was associated with larger practices and those with
              younger GPs. From 2016/2017 onwards more deprived practice
              populations were associated with decreased cancer detection.
              CONCLUSION: From 2009/2010 to 2018/2019 2WW referrals increased
              on average by 10\% year on year. The most consistent association
              with higher cancer detection was found for larger practices and
              those with younger GPs, though these differences became
              attenuated over time. The more recent association between
              increased practice deprivation and lower cancer detection is a
              cause for concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant
              impacts on 2WW referral activity and the impact on patient
              outcomes will need to be studied.",

  abstract  = "Introduction: The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic has been
               highly disruptive for people with cancer. Furthermore, it has
               been shown that accrual to cancer trials dropped substantially
               in 2020. Building on findings from a previous pilot survey, the
               present study used qualitative methods to gain insights into
               attitudes towards participation in research studies amongst
               people who have experienced cancer, in the context of the first
               year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We
               interviewed 13 participants from the UK, who were purposively
               sampled, including a broad sample of cancer types, and a mixture
               of individuals who have and have not taken part in research
               previously. Participants underwent semi-structured interviews
               (median interview duration: 47 min) and were asked open-ended
               questions about their attitude towards and experiences with
               COVID-19, and their attitude towards research participation. In
               addition to this, prompts were used to ask participants about
               concerns that were highlighted by our previous quantitative work
               on this topic, such as concerns about being older or having to
               travel to participate. Interview transcripts were analysed using
               a framework analysis approach. Results: Our findings suggest
               that cancer patient decision-making about research participation
               during an infectious disease pandemic may be a function of a
               basic cost-benefit analysis, which considers the benefit of
               taking part, either personally to themselves or to wider
               society. The benefit may then be weighed by the patient against
               the risk of being infected, which may be influenced by trust in
               the relevant clinicians/researchers; familiarity with the study
               location; provision of detailed information on safety protocols
               for infectious disease; and, in particular, the availability of
               safe transport to and from the study location. Discussion: Some
               cancer patients say that they would be less likely to
               participate in a research study in the middle of an infectious
               disease pandemic due to an increased risk to themselves.
               Patients' perceived risk to themselves from participating may be
               ameliorated via the provision of certain practical solutions
               that can be considered at the study protocol design stage, such
               as safe travel, information, and the use of staff and study
               sites familiar to the patient.",

               disrupted breast cancer control through short-term declines in
               screening and delays in diagnosis and treatments. We projected
               the impact of COVID-19 on future breast cancer mortality between
               2020 and 2030. METHODS: Three established Cancer Intervention
               and Surveillance Modeling Network breast cancer models modeled
               reductions in mammography screening use, delays in symptomatic
               cancer diagnosis, and reduced use of chemotherapy for women with
               early-stage disease for the first 6 months of the pandemic with
               return to prepandemic patterns after that time. Sensitivity
               analyses were performed to determine the effect of key model
               parameters, including the duration of the pandemic impact.
               RESULTS: By 2030, the models project 950 (model range =
               860-1297) cumulative excess breast cancer deaths related to
               reduced screening, 1314 (model range = 266-1325) associated with
               delayed diagnosis of symptomatic cases, and 151 (model range =
               146-207) associated with reduced chemotherapy use in women with
               hormone positive, early-stage cancer. Jointly, 2487 (model range
               = 1713-2575) excess breast cancer deaths were estimated,
               representing a 0.52\% (model range = 0.36\%-0.56\%) cumulative
               increase over breast cancer deaths expected by 2030 in the
               absence of the pandemic's disruptions. Sensitivity analyses
               indicated that the breast cancer mortality impact would be
               approximately double if the modeled pandemic effects on
               screening, symptomatic diagnosis, and chemotherapy extended for
               12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Initial pandemic-related disruptions in
               breast cancer care will have a small long-term cumulative impact
               on breast cancer mortality. Continued efforts to ensure prompt
               return to screening and minimize delays in evaluation of
               symptomatic women can largely mitigate the effects of the
               initial pandemic-associated disruptions.",

               an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVE:
               These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of
               Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians,
               and other health care professionals in making decisions about
               the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis in patients
               with COVID-19-related critical illness who do not have confirmed
               or suspected VTE. METHODS: ASH formed a multidisciplinary
               guideline panel that included 3 patient representatives and
               applied strategies to minimize potential bias from conflicts of
               interest. The McMaster University Grading of Recommendations
               Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre supported
               the guideline development process by performing systematic
               evidence reviews (up to 5 March 2021). The panel prioritized
               clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance
               for clinicians and patients. The panel used the GRADE approach
               to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject
               to public comment. This is an update on guidelines published in
               February 2021. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 1 additional
               recommendation. The panel issued a conditional recommendation in
               favor of prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity
               anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19-related critical
               illness who do not have confirmed or suspected VTE. CONCLUSIONS:
               This recommendation was based on low certainty in the evidence,
               which underscores the need for additional high-quality,
               randomized, controlled trials comparing different intensities of

               Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), the
               precursor of MM has been associated with immune dysfunction
               which may lead to severe COVID-19. No systematic data have been
               published on COVID-19 in individuals with MGUS. We conducted a

               SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 among individuals with
               MGUS. We included 75,422 Icelanders born before 1976, who had
               been screened for MGUS in the Iceland Screens Treats or Prevents
               Multiple Myeloma study (iStopMM). Data on SARS-CoV-2 testing and
               COVID-19 severity were acquired from the Icelandic COVID-19
               Study Group. Using a test-negative study design, we included
               32,047 iStopMM participants who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2,

               includes patients with the recently described immune-mediated
               necrotizing myopathies (IMNM) who have specific antibodies, such
               as anti-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase or anti-signal
               recognition particle, seronegative phenotypes that can be
               associated with cancer, and other types of myositis and
               connective tissue diseases involving necrotic muscle fibers as a
               characteristic pathologic feature. Necrotizing myopathies that
               are not immune-mediated, such as those caused by drugs,
               dystrophies, infections, or even hypothyroidism are also
               included. The purpose of this review is to address the
               differential diagnosis of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: New
               IMNM have been described over the last few years, some of them
               related with checkpoint inhibitors, drugs that are being
               increasingly used in cancer treatment. Necrotizing myopathy has
               also been reported in association with specific phenotypes and
               autoantibodies (e.g. anti-Mi2 dermatomyositis, antisynthetase
               syndrome, and myositis associated with antimitochondrial
               antibodies). Rarer cases associated with graft-versus-host
               disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               infection are also emerging. SUMMARY: Differentiation between
               patients with IMNM and those without the superimposed autoimmune
               phenomena helps clinicians determine the best individualized
               approach to use and the appropriate immunosuppressive therapy,

               objective of determining if oral N-BPs treatment can play a role
               in the susceptibility to development of severe COVID-19.

               of Italian population (9\% sample of the overall population),
               were analyzed. Oral N-BPs (mainly alendronate and risedronate)
               were included in the analysis, zoledronic acid was excluded
               because of the low number of patients at risk. Incidence of
               COVID-19 hospitalization was 12.32 (95\% confidence interval
               [CI], 9.61-15.04) and 11.55 (95\% CI, 8.91-14.20), of intensive
               care unit (ICU) utilization because of COVID-19 was 1.25 (95\%
               CI, 0.38-2.11) and 1.42 (95\% CI, 0.49-2.36), and of all-cause
               death was 4.06 (95\% CI, 2.50-5.61) and 3.96 (95\% CI,
               2.41-5.51) for oral N-BPs users and nonusers, respectively.
               Sensitivity analyses that excluded patients with prevalent
               vertebral or hip fragility fractures and without concomitant
               glucocorticoid treatment yielded similar results. In conclusion,
               we found that the incidence of COVID-19 hospitalization,
               intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and COVID-19 potentially
               related mortality were similar in N-BPs-treated and nontreated
               subjects. Similar results were found in N-BPs versus other
               anti-osteoporotic drugs. We provide real-life data on the safety
               of oral N-BPs in terms of severe COVID-19 risk on a
               population-based cohort. Our results do not support the
               hypothesis that oral N-BPs can prevent COVID-19 infection and/or
               severe COVID-19; however, they do not seem to increase the risk.

               factors were retrospectively investigated for associations with
               pre-radiotherapy sleep disturbances in 77 lung cancer patients.
               Factors included COVID-19 pandemic; age; gender; performance
               score; comorbidity index; history of another malignancy;
               distress score; number of emotional, physical or practical

               new diagnoses and worsening disease stage due to diagnostic
               delay. METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups: the
               control group with a first diagnosis of HNC in 10 months before
               the national lockdown (March 9th, 2020) and the study group with
               a first diagnosis of HNC in 10 months after lockdown. RESULTS: A
               total of 124 patients were included in the study. Before the
               spread of COVID-19, 79 new diagnoses of HNCs were registered,
               while in the period after the lockdown, 45 new cancers cases
               were diagnosed and the difference was statistically significant
               (p = 0.01278). Early clinical T-stage results showed 52 cases in

               with hematological malignancies at high risk of contracting the
               virus. We aimed to evaluate how it affected such patients during
               the second lockdown in Israel. METHODS: This national survey
               included Hebrew-speaking patients with hematological malignancy.
               This included three tools with 28 items of sociodemographic and
               medical baseline characteristics, management of hematological
               disease, and evaluation of emotional coping during COVID-19
               pandemic; the Hebrew version of the Patient Health Questionnaire
               9; and 3 qualitative open-ended questions. Data was analyzed by
               mixed methods which combined both quantitative and qualitative
               thematic analyses. RESULTS: Four hundred eight patients
               responded to the survey. The management of their hematological
               disease included a decrease in the number of visits to the
               hematology clinic (37.0\%), delay of some treatment schedules
               (9.1\%), and prescription of replacement therapies permitting
               less visits to the clinic (2.2\%). The frequency and intensity
               of ``feeling afraid'' regarding COVID-19 infection was increased
               (mean $\pm$ SD: 4 $\pm$ 1 to 5 $\pm$ 2 in a 1-7 Likert scale),
               and a high rate of depression was recorded, which appeared to be
               more evident in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (p
               < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The management of hematological
               malignancies during pandemics should always take into
               consideration patients' fears, as well as the development of
               depression related to isolation and loneliness, in addition to
               the high risk of severe disease. Patients with CML had a high
               rate of depression which obviously needs to be managed very

               disorder that affects most individuals at one time or another.
               During depression, there are changes in mood and behavior,
               accompanied by feelings of defeat, hopelessness, or even
               suicidal thoughts. Depression has a direct or indirect relation
               with a number of other diseases including Alzheimer's disease,
               stroke, epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.
               In addition, antidepressant drugs have several side effects
               including sedation, increased weight, indigestion, sexual
               dysfunction, or a decrease in blood pressure. Stopping
               medication may cause a relapse of the symptoms of depression and

               individuals contacting patients and medical staff with a number
               of mental disorders that may adversely affect the immune ability
               of their bodies. Some of the drugs currently included in the
               protocols for treating COVID-19 may negatively affect the mental
               health of patients. Evidence accumulated over the years
               indicates that serotonin (5HT) deficiencies and norepinephrine
               (NE) in the brain can lead to mental depression. Drugs that
               increase levels of NE and 5HT are commonly used in the treatment
               of depression. The common reason for mood disorders, including
               mania and bipolar disease are not clearly understood. It is
               assumed that hyperactivity in specific parts of the brain and
               excessive activity of neurotransmitters may be involved. Early
               diagnosis and developing new treatment strategies are essential
               for the prevention of the severe consequences of depression. In
               addition, extensive research should be directed towards the
               investigation of the mental health disturbances occurring during
               and/or after COVID-19 infection. This may lead to the
               incorporation of a suitable antidepressant into the current
               treatment protocols.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma has been widely used to treat
               COVID-19 and is under investigation in numerous randomized
               clinical trials, but results are publicly available only for a
               small number of trials. The objective of this study was to
               assess the benefits of convalescent plasma treatment compared to
               placebo or no treatment and all-cause mortality in patients with
               COVID-19, using data from all available randomized clinical
               trials, including unpublished and ongoing trials (Open Science
               Framework, https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GEHFX ). METHODS: In
               this collaborative systematic review and meta-analysis, clinical
               trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical
               Trials Registry Platform), the Cochrane COVID-19 register, the
               LOVE database, and PubMed were searched until April 8, 2021.
               Investigators of trials registered by March 1, 2021, without
               published results were contacted via email. Eligible were
               ongoing, discontinued and completed randomized clinical trials
               that compared convalescent plasma with placebo or no treatment
               in COVID-19 patients, regardless of setting or treatment
               schedule. Aggregated mortality data were extracted from
               publications or provided by investigators of unpublished trials
               and combined using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman random
               effects model. We investigated the contribution of unpublished
               trials to the overall evidence. RESULTS: A total of 16,477
               patients were included in 33 trials (20 unpublished with 3190
               patients, 13 published with 13,287 patients). 32 trials enrolled
               only hospitalized patients (including 3 with only intensive care
               unit patients). Risk of bias was low for 29/33 trials. Of 8495
               patients who received convalescent plasma, 1997 died (23\%), and
               of 7982 control patients, 1952 died (24\%). The combined risk
               ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.97 (95\% confidence
               interval: 0.92; 1.02) with between-study heterogeneity not
               beyond chance (I2 = 0\%). The RECOVERY trial had 69.8\% and the
               unpublished evidence 25.3\% of the weight in the meta-analysis.
               CONCLUSIONS: Convalescent plasma treatment of patients with
               COVID-19 did not reduce all-cause mortality. These results
               provide strong evidence that convalescent plasma treatment for
               patients with COVID-19 should not be used outside of randomized
               trials. Evidence synthesis from collaborations among trial
               investigators can inform both evidence generation and evidence
               application in patient care.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Surgery remains the first curative treatment for
               colorectal cancer. Prehabilitation seems to attenuate the loss
               of lean mass in the early postoperative period. However, its
               long-term role has not been studied. Lockdown due to the
               COVID-19 pandemic has forced to carry out the prehabilitation
               program at home. This study aimed to assess the effect of home
               prehabilitation on body composition, complications, and hospital
               stay in patients undergoing oncological colorectal surgery.
               METHODS: A prospective and randomized clinical study was
               conducted in 20 patients operated of colorectal cancer during
               COVID-19 lockdown (13 March to 21 June 2020) in a single
               university clinical hospital. Patients were randomized into two
               study groups (10 per group): prehabilitation vs standard care.
               Changes in lean mass and fat mass at 45 and 90 days after
               surgery were measured using multifrequency bioelectrical
               impedance analysis. RESULTS: Prehabilitation managed to reduce
               hospital stay (4.8 vs 7.2 days, p = 0.052) and postoperative
               complications (20\% vs 50\%, p = 0.16). Forty-five days after
               surgery, the loss of lean mass decreased (1.7\% vs 7.1\%, p =
               0.17). These differences in lean mass were attenuated at 90
               days; however, the standard care group increased considerably
               their fat mass compared to the prehabilitation group (+ 8.72\%
               vs - 8.16\%). CONCLUSIONS: Home prehabilitation has proven its
               effectiveness, achieving an attenuation of lean mass loss in the
               early postoperative period and a lower gain in fat mass in the
               late postoperative period. In addition, it has managed to reduce

  abstract  = "Severe COVID-19 pneumonia has been associated with the
               development of intense inflammatory responses during the course
               of infections with SARS-CoV-2. Given that human endogenous
               retroviruses (HERVs) are known to be activated during and
               participate in inflammatory processes, we examined whether HERV
               dysregulation signatures are present in COVID-19 patients. By
               comparing transcriptomes of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
               of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and peripheral blood
               monocytes (PBMCs) from patients and controls, we have shown that
               HERVs are intensely dysregulated in BALF of COVID-19 patients
               compared to those in BALF of healthy control patients but not in
               PBMCs. In particular, upregulation in the expression of specific
               HERV families was detected in BALF samples of COVID-19 patients,
               with HERV-FRD being the most highly upregulated family among the
               families analyzed. In addition, we compared the expression of
               HERVs in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) without and
               after senescence induction in an oncogene-induced senescence
               model in order to quantitatively measure changes in the
               expression of HERVs in bronchial cells during the process of
               cellular senescence. This apparent difference of HERV
               dysregulation between PBMCs and BALF warrants further studies in
               the involvement of HERVs in inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms
               as well as exploration of HERVs as potential biomarkers for
               disease progression. Furthermore, the increase in the expression
               of HERVs in senescent HBECs in comparison to that in noninduced
               HBECs provides a potential link for increased COVID-19 severity
               and mortality in aged populations. IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 emerged
               in late 2019 in China, causing a global pandemic. Severe
               COVID-19 is characterized by intensive inflammatory responses,
               and older age is an important risk factor for unfavorable
               outcomes. HERVs are remnants of ancient infections whose
               expression is upregulated in multiple conditions, including
               cancer and inflammation, and their expression is increased with
               increasing age. The significance of this work is that we were
               able to recognize dysregulated expression of endogenous
               retroviral elements in BALF samples but not in PBMCs of COVID-19
               patients. At the same time, we were able to identify upregulated
               expression of multiple HERV families in senescence-induced HBECs
               in comparison to that in noninduced HBECs, a fact that could
               possibly explain the differences in disease severity among age
               groups. These results indicate that HERV expression might play a
               pathophysiological role in local inflammatory pathways in lungs
               afflicted by SARS-CoV-2 and their expression could be a
               potential therapeutic target.",

               diagnoses and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection will require surgical
               treatment. The objective of this study was to determine whether
               a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of adverse
               postoperative events following surgery in patients with cancer.
               METHODS: This was a propensity-matched cohort study from April
               6, 2020 to October 31, 2020 at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.
               Cancer patients were identified who underwent elective surgery
               after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection and matched to
               controls based on patient, disease, and surgical factors.
               Primary study outcome was a composite of the following adverse
               postoperative events that occurred within 30 days of surgery:
               death, unplanned readmission, pneumonia, cardiac injury, or
               thromboembolic event. RESULTS: A total of 5682 patients were
               included for study, and 114 (2.0\%) had a prior SARS-CoV-2
               infection. The average time from infection to surgery was 52
               (range 20-202) days. Compared with matched controls, there was
               no difference in the rate of adverse postoperative outcome
               (14.3\% vs. 13.4\%, p = 1.0). Patients with a SARS-CoV-2-related
               inpatient admission before surgery had increased odds of
               postoperative complication (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 7.4
               [1.6-34.3], p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A minimal wait time of 20
               days after recovering from minimally symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
               infection appears to be safe for cancer patients undergoing
               low-risk elective surgery. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections
               requiring inpatient treatment were at increased risk for adverse
               events after surgery. Additional wait time may be required in
               those with more severe infections.",

               breast group, ``enhanced care'' showed moderate positive
               perception (mean 4.40) among less-educated women that was
               slightly lower among better-educated women (mean 4.14) with a
               significant difference (P = 0.034). ``satisfaction'' had an
               opposite pattern: a mean of 3.99 for a lower level of education
               and 4.78 for a higher level of education, with a strong
               significant difference (P < 0.001). ``privacy and discomfort''
               approached neutrality for less-educated women, while for
               higher-educated women the lower mean of 2.93 indicted a more
               positive perception (P = 0.007). In the pelvic group, younger
               women had a better perception towards telemedicine for
               ``telemedicine as a substitution'' (mean 3.68) compared to older
               women (mean 3.05). The privacy and discomfort subscale was in

               less-educated women (mean 3.28; P = 0.042). CONCLUSION:
               Telemedicine was generally well accepted, not only among younger

               Observational retrospective cohort study of 243 adult patients
               with severe COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at
               a Brazilian tertiary hospital. RESULTS: The incidence of all
               thromboembolic events was 14.8\%, in which 3.8\% developed deep
               vein thrombosis, 7.8\% pulmonary embolism, 2.5\% acute
               myocardial infarction, 1.2\% stroke, and 1.2\% peripheral artery
               occlusion. Risk factors identified were D-dimer at admission

               cumulative risk of developing thromboembolic events at day 28

               responses, yet the role of immunometabolism in COVID-19
               pathogenesis remains unclear. By investigating 87 patients with
               confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 critically ill non-COVID-19
               patients, and 47 uninfected controls, we found an
               immunometabolic dysregulation in patients with progressed
               COVID-19. Specifically, T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes
               exhibited increased mitochondrial mass, yet only T cells
               accumulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), were
               metabolically quiescent, and showed a disrupted mitochondrial
               architecture. During recovery, T cell ROS decreased to match the
               uninfected controls. Transcriptionally, T cells from
               severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed an induction of
               ROS-responsive genes as well as genes related to mitochondrial
               function and the basigin network. Basigin (CD147) ligands
               cyclophilin A and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggered ROS
               production in T cells in vitro. In line with this, only
               PCR-positive patients showed increased ROS levels. Dexamethasone
               treatment resulted in a downregulation of ROS in vitro and T
               cells from dexamethasone-treated patients exhibited low ROS and
               basigin levels. This was reflected by changes in the
               transcriptional landscape. Our findings provide evidence of an

               COVID-19 is recommended, but data on the immunogenicity and
               safety of COVID-19 vaccines for patients with solid tumours
               receiving systemic cancer treatment are scarce. Therefore, we
               aimed to assess the impact of immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and
               chemoimmunotherapy on the immunogenicity and safety of the
               mRNA-1273 (Moderna Biotech, Madrid, Spain) COVID-19 vaccine as
               part of the Vaccination Against COVID in Cancer (VOICE) trial.
               METHODS: This prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority trial
               was done across three centres in the Netherlands. Individuals
               aged 18 years or older with a life expectancy of more than 12
               months were enrolled into four cohorts: individuals without
               cancer (cohort A [control cohort]), and patients with solid
               tumours, regardless of stage and histology, treated with
               immunotherapy (cohort B), chemotherapy (cohort C), or
               chemoimmunotherapy (cohort D). Participants received two
               mRNA-1273 vaccinations of 100 $\mu$g in 0·5 mL intramuscularly,
               28 days apart. The primary endpoint, analysed per protocol

               antibody units (BAU)/mL], indicating previous SARS-CoV-2

               serum antibody response (ie, SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody
               concentration of >10 BAU/mL) 28 days after the second
               vaccination. For the primary endpoint analysis, a
               non-inferiority design with a margin of 10\% was used. We also
               assessed adverse events in all patients who received at least
               one vaccination, and recorded solicited adverse events in
               participants who received at least one vaccination but excluding

               NCT04715438. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and March 12, 2021, 791
               participants were enrolled and followed up for a median of 122
               days (IQR 118 to 128). A SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody response
               was found in 240 (100\%; 95\% CI 98 to 100) of 240 evaluable
               participants in cohort A, 130 (99\%; 96 to >99) of 131 evaluable
               patients in cohort B, 223 (97\%; 94 to 99) of 229 evaluable
               patients in cohort C, and 143 (100\%; 97 to 100) of 143
               evaluable patients in cohort D. The SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody
               response in each patient cohort was non-inferior compared with
               cohort A. No new safety signals were observed. Grade 3 or worse
               serious adverse events occurred in no participants in cohort A,
               three (2\%) of 137 patients in cohort B, six (2\%) of 244
               patients in cohort C, and one (1\%) of 163 patients in cohort D,
               with four events (two of fever, and one each of diarrhoea and
               febrile neutropenia) potentially related to the vaccination.
               There were no vaccine-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Most
               patients with cancer develop, while receiving chemotherapy,
               immunotherapy, or both for a solid tumour, an adequate antibody
               response to vaccination with the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine. The
               vaccine is also safe in these patients. The minority of patients
               with an inadequate response after two vaccinations might benefit
               from a third vaccination. FUNDING: ZonMw, The Netherlands

               study, we aimed to estimate the long-term prevalence of
               psychophysical olfactory, gustatory , and chemesthesis
               impairment at least one year after SARS-CoV-2 infection
               considering the background of chemosensory dysfunction in
               non-COVID-19 population. METHODOLOGY: This case-controlled study
               included 100 patients who were home-isolated for mildly
               symptomatic COVID-19 between March and April 2020. One control
               regularly tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and always tested
               negative was matched to each case according to gender and age.
               Chemosensory function was investigated by a comprehensive
               psychophysical evaluation including ortho- and retronasal
               olfaction and an extensive assessment of gustatory function.
               Differences in chemosensory parameters were evaluated through
               either Fisher{\^a}€™s exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test.
               RESULTS: The psychophysical assessment of chemosensory function
               took place after a median of 401 days from the first SARS-CoV-2
               positive swab. The evaluation of orthonasal smell identified
               46\% and 10\% of cases and controls, respectively, having
               olfactory dysfunction, with 7\% of COVID-19 cases being
               functionally anosmic. Testing of gustatory function revealed a
               27\% of cases versus 10\% of controls showing a gustatory
               impairment. Nasal trigeminal sensitivity was significantly lower
               in cases compared to controls. Persistent chemosensory
               impairment was associated with emotional distress and
               depression. CONCLUSION: More than one year after the onset of
               COVID-19, cases exhibited an excess of olfactory, gustatory ,
               and chemesthesis disturbances compared to matched-pair controls

               manifestation at presentation, the laboratory and imaging
               results, and the prognosis of COVID-19 differ in patients who
               tested negative at the first RT-PCR compared with those who
               tested positive and also to evaluate if comorbid conditions
               patient-related or the period of arrival are associated with
               negative testing. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively collected
               clinical data of patients who accessed the ED from March 1 to
               May 15, 2020. METHODS: We compared clinical variables, comorbid
               conditions, and clinical outcomes in the two groups by
               univariate analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Patients
               who tested negative at the first RT-PCR showed a higher
               prevalence of cardiopathy, immunosuppression, and diabetes, as
               well as a higher leukocyte and lower lymphocyte counts compared
               with patients who tested positive. A bilateral interstitial
               syndrome and a typical pattern at computed tomography scan were
               prevalent in the test-negative group. Test-negative patients
               were more likely to be admitted to the hospital but less likely
               to need admission in a high level of care ward. The
               false-negative rate increased from March to May. CONCLUSION:
               False-negative RT-PCR COVID-19 patients present a similar
               spectrum of symptoms compared with positive cohort, but more
               comorbidities. Imaging helps to identify them. True positives

               pneumonia with those of other infections; however, to our
               knowledge, no studies to date have included noninfectious
               organizing pneumonia (OP) for comparison. OBJECTIVE. The
               objectives of this study were to compare chest CT features of
               COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design and to
               assess the performance of radiologists in distinguishing between
               these conditions. METHODS. This retrospective study included 150
               chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean [$\pm$ SD] age, 58
               $\pm$ 16 years) with a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or
               non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations
               per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed
               CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and for
               Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category
               and recorded a favored diagnosis. The CT characteristics of the
               three diagnoses were compared using random-effects models; the
               diagnostic performance of the readers was assessed. RESULTS.
               COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p < .05) from
               influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, although
               it was different (p < .05) from OP for four of 14 findings
               (central or diffuse distribution was seen in 10\% and 7\% of
               COVID-19 cases, respectively, vs 20\% and 21\% of OP cases,
               respectively; unilateral distribution was seen in 1\% of
               COVID-19 cases vs 7\% of OP cases; non-tree-in-bud nodules was
               seen in 32\% of COVID-19 cases vs 53\% of OP cases; tree-in-bud
               nodules were seen in 6\% of COVID-19 cases vs 14\% of OP cases).
               A total of 70\% of cases of COVID-19, 33\% of influenza cases,
               and 47\% of OP cases had typical findings according to RSNA
               COVID-19 category assessment (p < .001). The mean percentage of
               correct favored diagnoses compared with actual diagnoses was
               44\% for COVID-19, 29\% for influenza, and 39\% for OP. The mean
               diagnostic accuracy of favored diagnoses was 70\% for COVID-19
               pneumonia and 68\% for both influenza and OP. CONCLUSION. CT
               findings of COVID-19 substantially overlap with those of
               influenza and, to a greater extent, those of OP. The diagnostic
               accuracy of the radiologists was low in a study sample that
               contained equal proportions of these three types of pneumonia.
               CLINICAL IMPACT. Recognized challenges in diagnosing COVID-19 by
               CT are furthered by the strong overlap observed between the
               appearances of COVID-19 and OP on CT. This challenge may be
               particularly evident in clinical settings in which there are
               substantial proportions of patients with potential causes of OP
               such as ongoing cancer therapy or autoimmune conditions.",

               in which the p65/p50 heterodimer is the most abundant complex,
               that play critical roles mainly in inflammation. Glucocorticoid

               evaluate the effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
               on tumor board presentations in a high-volume tertiary referral
               center (the German Comprehensive Cancer Center NCT/UCC Dresden),
               we compared the number of presentations of gastrointestinal
               tumors stratified by tumor entity, tumor stage, and treatment
               intention during the pandemic to the respective data from
               previous years. Results: The number of presentations decreased
               by 3.2\% (95\% CI -8.8, 2.7) during the COVID year 2020 compared
               with the pre-COVID year 2019. During the first shutdown,

               (scRNAseq) level in tumors and patients with coronavirus disease
               2019 (COVID-19) requires both a reference differentiation
               trajectory of $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells and a robust mapping
               method for additional $\gamma$$\delta$ T lymphocytes. Here, we
               incepted such a method to characterize thousands of
               $\gamma$$\delta$ T lymphocytes from (n = 95) patients with
               cancer or adult and pediatric COVID-19 disease. We found that
               cancer patients with human papillomavirus-positive head and neck
               squamous cell carcinoma and Epstein-Barr virus-positive
               Hodgkin's lymphoma have $\gamma$$\delta$ tumor-infiltrating T
               lymphocytes that are more prone to recirculate from the tumor
               and avoid exhaustion. In COVID-19, both TCRV$\gamma$9 and
               TCRV$\gamma$non9 subsets of $\gamma$$\delta$ T lymphocytes
               relocalize from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the
               infected lung tissue, where their advanced differentiation,
               tissue residency, and exhaustion reflect T cell activation.
               Although severe COVID-19 disease increases both recruitment and
               exhaustion of $\gamma$$\delta$ T lymphocytes in infected lung
               lesions but not blood, the anti-IL6R therapy with Tocilizumab
               promotes $\gamma$$\delta$ T lymphocyte differentiation in
               patients with COVID-19. PBMC from pediatric patients with acute
               COVID-19 disease display similar $\gamma$$\delta$ T cell
               lymphopenia to that seen in adult patients. However, blood
               $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells from children with the COVID-19-related
               multisystem inflammatory syndrome are not lymphodepleted, but
               they are differentiated as in healthy PBMC. These findings
               suggest that some virus-induced memory $\gamma$$\delta$ T
               lymphocytes durably persist in the blood of adults and could
               subsequently infiltrate and recirculate in tumors.",

  abstract  = "Importance: Novel therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection are
               urgently needed. Antineoplastic compounds that target cellular
               machinery used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry and replication,
               including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), may disrupt
               SARS-CoV-2 activity. Objectives: To determine whether patients
               with cancer treated with potential ACE2-lowering antineoplastic
               compounds exhibit lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates. Design,
               Setting, and Participants: We used the Library of Integrated
               Network-Based Cellular Signatures database to identify
               antineoplastic compounds associated with decreased ACE2 gene
               expression across cell lines. We then evaluated a retrospective
               cohort of 1701 patients who were undergoing antineoplastic
               therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York,
               New York, during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine if treatment
               with an ACE2-lowering antineoplastic was associated with a
               decreased odds ratio (OR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients
               included in the analysis underwent active treatment for cancer
               and received a SARS-CoV-2 test between March 10 and May 28,
               2020. Main Outcome and Measure: The association between
               potential ACE2-lowering antineoplastic treatment and a positive
               SARS-CoV-2 test. Results: In the cohort of 1701 patients,
               SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were determined for 949 (55.8\%)
               female and 752 (44.2\%) male patients (mean [SD] age, 63.1
               [13.1] years) with diverse cancers receiving antineoplastic
               therapy. In silico analysis of gene expression signatures after
               drug treatment identified 91 compounds associated with
               downregulation of ACE2 across cell lines. Of the total cohort,
               215 (12.6\%) patients were treated with 8 of these compounds,
               including 3 mTOR/PI3K inhibitors and 2 antimetabolites. In a
               multivariable analysis of patients who received an ACE2-lowering
               antineoplastic adjusting for confounders, 15 of 215 (7.0\%)
               patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test compared with 191 of
               1486 (12.9\%) patients who received other antineoplastic
               therapies (OR, 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.88). Findings were
               confirmed in additional sensitivity analyses including cancer
               type, steroid use, and a propensity-matched subcohort.
               Gemcitabine treatment was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2
               infection (OR, 0.42; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.87). Conclusions and
               Relevance: In this cohort study, in silico analysis of
               drug-associated gene expression signatures identified potential
               ACE2-lowering antineoplastic compounds, including mTOR/PI3K
               inhibitors and antimetabolites. Patients who received these
               compounds exhibited statistically significantly lower rates of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with patients given other
               antineoplastics. Further evaluation of the biological and
               clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of identified antineoplastic
               compounds is warranted.",

               an unprecedented experience that has had profound impact and
               consequences for health care providers, visitation policies, and
               procedures. Hospitals and health care facilities were forced to
               implement changes to visitation policies, in an effort, to
               minimize transmission of the virus, which unfortunately had
               negative impact on patients' and family members' well-being as
               well as moral distress for the staff. Objectives: We present

               infection in children with cancer or after haematopoietic stem
               cell transplant (HSCT). We describe the severity and outcomes of
               SARS-COV-2 in these patients and identify factors associated
               with severe disease. METHODS: This was a multinational,
               observational study of children (aged <19 years) with cancer or
               HSCT and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction.
               COVID-19 was classified as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe
               or critical ($\geq$1 organ support). Exact polytomous regression
               was used to determine the relationship between clinical
               variables and disease severity. RESULTS: One hundred and
               thirty-one patients with COVID-19 across 10 countries were
               identified (median age 8 years). Seventy-eight (60\%) had
               leukaemia/lymphoma, 48 (37\%) had solid tumour and five had
               primary immunodeficiency and HSCT. Fever (71\%), cough (47\%)
               and coryza (29\%) were the most frequent symptoms. The median
               duration of detectable virus was 16 days (range, 1-79 days).
               Forty-nine patients (37\%) were hospitalised for COVID-19
               symptoms, and 15 (11\%) required intensive care unit-level care.
               Chemotherapy was delayed/modified in 35\% of patients. COVID-19
               was asymptomatic in 32\% of patients, mild in 47\%, moderate in
               8\%, severe in 4\% and critical in 9\%. In 124 patients (95\%),
               a full recovery was documented, and four (3\%) died due to
               COVID-19. Any comorbidity (odds ratio, 2.94; 95\% confidence
               interval [CI], 1.81-5.21), any coinfection (1.74; 95\% CI
               1.03-3.03) and severe baseline neutropenia (1.82; 95\% CI
               1.13-3.09) were independently and significantly associated with
               increasing disease severity. CONCLUSION: Although most children
               with cancer had asymptomatic/mild disease, 13\% had severe
               COVID-19 and 3\% died. Comorbidity, coinfection and neutropenia
               may increase the risk of severe disease. Our data may help

               safety and implementation of telehealth services in surgery, and
               telehealth usage in Australia between 2020 and 2021. METHODS:
               PubMed was searched from 2015 to 2021 for systematic reviews
               evaluating real-time telehealth modalities in surgery. Outcomes
               of interest were patient and provider satisfaction, safety, and
               barriers and facilitators associated with its use. Study quality
               was appraised using the AMSTAR 2 tool. A working group of
               surgeons provided insights into the clinical relevance to
               telehealth in surgical practice of the evidence collated.
               RESULTS: From 2025 identified studies, 17 were included, which
               were of low to moderate risk of bias. Patient and provider
               satisfaction with telehealth was high. Time savings, decreased
               healthcare resource use and lower costs were reported as key
               advantages of the service. Inability to perform comprehensive
               examinations was noted as the primary barrier. In Australia,
               peak telehealth usage coincided with the introduction of
               temporary telehealth services and increased lockdown measures.
               CONCLUSIONS: Patients and providers are broadly satisfied with
               telehealth and its benefits. Barriers may be overcome via
               multidisciplinary collaboration. Telehealth may benefit surgical

               evaluate the experience and perceptions of patients with cancer
               undergoing SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients
               on SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic were eligible for
               participation. Data were collected by anonymous survey over a 1
               week period during the most intensive phase of government
               restrictions. Patients were asked questions under three
               headings: perceived risk of infection exposure, changes to
               treatment plan and psychological impact of Covid-19. RESULTS:
               One hundred patients were assessed, 60\% were male, 41\% were >
               65 years of age and 67\% had advanced cancer. Eleven percent of
               patients were living alone. Fifty-seven percent reported feeling
               at increased risk in general of contracting Covid-19.
               Sixty-eight percent of patients did not feel worried about
               contracting Covid-19 in the hospital. Ninety-two percent of
               patients reported wanting to continue on SACT as originally

               increased anxiety. CONCLUSION: Though patients on active
               treatment for cancer during the Covid-19 pandemic reported
               increased anxiety and feelings of isolation due to Covid-19, the

               describes patients with prior lung disease hospitalised for
               COVID-19 (March-April 2020) or influenza (2018-2019 influenza
               outbreak). We compared the resulting pulmonary complications,
               need for intensive care and in-hospital mortality depending on
               respiratory history and virus. RESULTS: In the 89 530 COVID-19
               cases, 16.03\% had at least one CRD, which was significantly
               less frequently than in the 45 819 seasonal influenza patients.
               Patients suffering from chronic respiratory failure, chronic
               obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis and
               pulmonary hypertension were under-represented, contrary to those
               with lung cancer, sleep apnoea, emphysema and interstitial lung
               diseases. COVID-19 patients with CRDs developed significantly
               more ventilator-associated pneumonia and pulmonary embolism than

               incompletely defined, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are a
               critical feature that will likely form a key correlate of
               protection against COVID-19. Here, we developed and optimized a
               high-throughput whole blood-based assay to determine the T-cell
               response associated with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or
               vaccination amongst 231 healthy donors and 68 cancer patients.
               Following overnight in vitro stimulation with
               SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides, blood plasma samples were analysed
               for TH 1-type cytokines. Highly significant differential
               IFN-$\gamma$+ /IL-2+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were
               seen amongst previously infected COVID-19-positive healthy
               donors in comparison with unknown / na{\"\i}ve individuals (p <
               0·0001). IFN-$\gamma$ production was more effective at
               identifying asymptomatic donors, demonstrating higher
               sensitivity (96·0\% vs. 83·3\%) but lower specificity (84·4\%
               vs. 92·5\%) than measurement of IL-2. A single COVID-19 vaccine
               dose induced IFN-$\gamma$ and/or IL-2 SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell
               responses in 116 of 128 (90·6\%) healthy donors, reducing
               significantly to 27 of 56 (48·2\%) when measured in cancer
               patients (p < 0·0001). A second dose was sufficient to boost
               T-cell responses in the majority (90·6\%) of cancer patients,
               albeit IFN-$\gamma$+ responses were still significantly lower
               overall than those induced in healthy donors (p = 0·034).
               Three-month post-vaccination T-cell responses also declined at a
               faster rate in cancer patients. Overall, this cost-effective
               standardizable test ensures accurate and comparable assessments
               of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses amenable to widespread
               population immunity testing, and identifies individuals at
               greater need of booster vaccinations.",

               crucial supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in
               cytokine response regulation against COVID-19. Hence, we carried
               out a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to maximise
               the use of everything that exists about the role of vitamin D in
               the COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in
               PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science up to December 18,
               2020. Studies focused on the role of vitamin D in confirmed
               COVID-19 patients were entered into the systematic review.
               RESULTS: Twenty-three studies containing 11 901 participants
               entered into the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis indicated that
               41\% of COVID-19 patients were suffering from vitamin D
               deficiency (95\% CI, 29\%-55\%), and in 42\% of patients, levels
               of vitamin D were insufficient (95\% CI, 24\%-63\%). The serum
               25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 20.3 ng/mL among all
               COVID-19 patients (95\% CI, 12.1-19.8). The odds of getting
               infected with SARS-CoV-2 are 3.3 times higher among individuals
               with vitamin D deficiency (95\% CI, 2.5-4.3). The chance of
               developing severe COVID-19 is about five times higher in
               patients with vitamin D deficiency (OR: 5.1, 95\% CI, 2.6-10.3).
               There is no significant association between vitamin D status and
               higher mortality rates (OR: 1.6, 95\% CI, 0.5-4.4). CONCLUSION:
               This study found that most of the COVID-19 patients were
               suffering from vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. Also, there
               is about three times higher chance of getting infected with

               disease, the mortality rate associated with Mucormycosis is more
               than 40\%. Spore coat proteins (CotH) are essential proteins in

               surgery was halted at RFH to redeploy resources and staff for
               the COVID-19 surge. Prioritizing of patients according to
               European Association of Urology guidance was introduced. Clinics
               and the specialist multidisciplinary team (SMDT) meetings were
               maintained with physical distancing, kidney surgery was moved to
               a COVID-protected site, and infection prevention measurements
               were enforced. During the 7 weeks of lockdown (23 March to 10
               May 2020), 234 cases were discussed at the SMDT meetings, 53\%

               The reduction in referrals was more pronounced for small and
               asymptomatic renal masses. Of 62 low-priority cancer patients,
               27 (43.5\%) were deferred. Only one (4\%) COVID-19 infection
               occurred postoperatively, and the patient made a full recovery.
               No increase in clinical or pathological upstaging could be
               detected in patients who underwent deferred surgery compared to
               pre-COVID practice. CONCLUSION: The first surge of the COVID-19

               such relationships for France during the coronavirus disease 19
               (COVID-19) epidemic. METHODS: We performed an observational
               study and dynamic modelling using a sigmoidal mixed effects
               model. All hospitals with COVID-19 patients were included (18
               March 2020-17 April 2020). Abstention rate of a concomitant
               national election was collected. RESULTS: Mean abstention rate
               in 2020 among departments was 52.5\% $\pm$ 6.4\% and had
               increased by a mean of 18.8\% as compared with the 2014
               election. There was a high degree of similarity of abstention
               between the two elections among the departments (P < 0.001).
               Among departments with a high outbreak intensity, those with a
               higher participation were not affected by significantly higher
               COVID-19 admissions after the elections. The sigmoidal model
               fitted the data from the different departments with a high
               degree of consistency. The covariate analysis showed that a
               significant association between participation and number of
               admitted patients was observed for both elections (2020: $\beta$
               = -5.36, P < 1e-9 and 2014: $\beta$ = -3.15, P < 1e-6)
               contradicting a direct specific causation of the 2020 election.
               Participation was not associated with the position of the
               inflexion point suggesting no effect in the speed of spread.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the surrounding intensity
               of the COVID-19 epidemic in France did not have any local impact
               on participation to a national election. The level of
               participation had no impact on the spread of the pandemic.",

               swab, with 7 positive results. From our cohort, 4 cases of
               pneumonia were diagnosed with computed tomography scan imaging:
               3 were related to COVID-19 infection, while the fourth was
               evaluated as an RT adverse event. From the entire series, 4
               patients died: 3 during hospitalization in intensive care unit
               of complications of COVID-19 and 1 of other causes neither
               COVID-19 nor cancer-related. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer hub allows for
               safe RT practice continuation while minimizing the spread of
               contagion in this frail patient population. A challenge for the
               future will be to understand pandemic consequences in cancer
               natural history and manage its clinical impact.",

               and sleep-related hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and
               COVID-19 outcomes remains unknown. Controversy exists regarding
               whether to continue treatment for SDB with positive airway
               pressure given concern for aerosolization with limited data to
               inform professional society recommendations. Objective: To
               investigate the association of SDB (identified via
               polysomnogram) and sleep-related hypoxia with (1) SARS-CoV-2
               positivity and (2) World Health Organization (WHO)-designated
               COVID-19 clinical outcomes while accounting for confounding
               including obesity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, cancer,
               and smoking history. Design, Setting, and Participants: This
               case-control study was conducted within the Cleveland Clinic
               Health System (Ohio and Florida) and included all patients who
               were tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and November 30, 2020,
               and who had an available sleep study record. Sleep indices and
               SARS-CoV-2 positivity were assessed with overlap propensity
               score weighting, and COVID-19 clinical outcomes were assessed
               using the institutional registry. Exposures: Sleep
               study-identified SDB (defined by frequency of apneas and
               hypopneas using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI]) and
               sleep-related hypoxemia (percentage of total sleep time at <90\%
               oxygen saturation [TST <90]). Main Outcomes and Measures:
               Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection and WHO-designated COVID-19
               clinical outcomes (hospitalization, use of supplemental oxygen,
               noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation or
               extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death). Results: Of 350
               710 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, 5402 (mean [SD] age, 56.4
               [14.5] years; 3005 women [55.6\%]) had a prior sleep study, of
               whom 1935 (35.8\%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 5402
               participants, 1696 were Black (31.4\%), 3259 were White
               (60.3\%), and 822 were of other race or ethnicity (15.2\%).
               Patients who were positive vs negative for SARS-CoV-2 had a
               higher AHI score (median, 16.2 events/h [IQR, 6.1-39.5 events/h]
               vs 13.6 events/h [IQR, 5.5-33.6 events/h]; P < .001) and
               increased TST <90 (median, 1.8\% sleep time [IQR, 0.10\%-12.8\%
               sleep time] vs 1.4\% sleep time [IQR, 0.10\%-10.8\% sleep time];
               P = .02). After overlap propensity score-weighted logistic
               regression, no SDB measures were associated with SARS-CoV-2
               positivity. Median TST <90 was associated with the
               WHO-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcome scale (adjusted
               odds ratio, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.74; P = .005). Time-to-event
               analyses showed sleep-related hypoxia associated with a 31\%
               higher rate of hospitalization and mortality (adjusted hazard
               ratio, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.57; P = .005). Conclusions and
               Relevance: In this case-control study, SDB and sleep-related
               hypoxia were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2
               positivity; however, once patients were infected with
               SARS-CoV-2, sleep-related hypoxia was an associated risk factor
               for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes.",

               patients.Na{\"\i}veVax experienced a delay in generating
               SARS-CoV-2 total antibody levels (TAb) and neutralizing
               antibodies (SNAb) after the 1st vaccine dose (D1), but a rapid
               increase in antibody levels was observed after the 2nd dose
               (D2). However, these never reached the robust levels observed in
               RecoVax. In fact, Na{\"\i}veVax TAb and SNAb levels decreased
               4-weeks post-D2 (p=0.003;p<0.001). For the most part, RecoVax

               levels 2-weeks post-D2; but SNAb decreased significantly

               lagged behind that of RecoVax for most of the follow-up periods,
               Na{\"\i}veVax did reach similar avidity by ~6-months post-D1.
               These data suggest that one vaccine dose elicits maximal

               despite decreasing levels in TAb and SNAb overtime, long-term

               patients treated for lymphoma or multiple myeloma in two
               tertiary hospitals in Seoul. Patients were divided into two
               groups: group 1 included patients who received chemotherapy
               between September and December 2019 (the control period), and
               group 2 included patients who received chemotherapy between
               September and December 2020 (the study period). Countermeasures
               to COVID-19 were applied to the patients in group 2. The
               countermeasures implemented included mask wearing and regular
               handwashing at home and in hospital; COVID-19 risk assessments
               on all hospital visitors; and pre-emptive COVID-19 screening for
               all newly hospitalized patients and their resident guardians.
               RESULTS: No differences in treatment outcomes, including
               treatment response, incidence and duration of neutropenia or
               neutropenic fever, delays in chemotherapy, or number of deaths

               scoping review and a review of current guidance and guidelines
               provided by professional bodies, representing relevant
               discipline groups for cancer supportive care, were conducted.
               RESULTS: We identified 19 papers and 23 telehealth guidance
               documents. The results highlight how the characteristics of
               patient group and healthcare provider influence the
               acceptability and utility of the service and establish a minimum
               set of preconditions. The reviews primarily examined
               patient-focused difficulties or issues with acceptability and
               efficacy, with only a minority highlighting how provider issues

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in
               Germany, as in most other places in Europe or worldwide, are
               still highly prevalent. Vaccination rates currently remain low,
               putting cancer patients at a continued risk of infection with
               SARS-CoV-2, while prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among
               cancer patients in Germany remains essentially unknown. METHODS:
               Between August 2020 and February 2021, patients admitted to our
               hospital were prospectively enrolled in our COVID-19 biobank.
               Collected sera were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-IgM/IgG using
               Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: One hundred and ten
               patients with cancer were included in this study. With 71 (65\%)
               patients, most had active cancer treatment, mainly chemotherapy
               (56\%). The most frequent diagnosis was gastrointestinal cancer
               (54\%) with pancreatic cancer being the most common cancer type
               (24\%). Hematologic malignancies were present in 21 patients
               (17\%). Among the cancer patients first diagnosed during the
               pandemic, the rate of palliative treatment situations tended to
               be higher (76\% vs. 67\%, p = 0.17). A history of SARS-CoV-2
               infection was documented in 15 (14\%) patients; however,
               SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 10 (67\%) patients only.
               Of the patients without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, none
               displayed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CONCLUSION: In the present
               single-center experience, a low serological prevalence of
               SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among cancer patients even after
               SARS-CoV-2 infection was found. The results support continued
               strict preventive measures as well as efforts toward faster
               vaccination, due to a low immunity level in the population.",

               known about SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced responses in
               immunosuppressed patients. We investigated induction of
               antigen-specific antibody, B cell and T cell responses
               longitudinally in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on
               anti-CD20 antibody monotherapy (n = 20) compared with healthy
               controls (n = 10) after BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccination.
               Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (aCD20)
               significantly reduced spike-specific and receptor-binding domain
               (RBD)-specific antibody and memory B cell responses in most
               patients, an effect ameliorated with longer duration from last
               aCD20 treatment and extent of B cell reconstitution. By
               contrast, all patients with MS treated with aCD20 generated
               antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses after vaccination.
               Treatment with aCD20 skewed responses, compromising circulating
               follicular helper T (TFH) cell responses and augmenting CD8 T
               cell induction, while preserving type 1 helper T (TH1) cell
               priming. Patients with MS treated with aCD20 lacking anti-RBD
               IgG had the most severe defect in circulating TFH responses and
               more robust CD8 T cell responses. These data define the nature
               of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune landscape in
               aCD20-treated patients and provide insights into coordinated
               mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses in humans. Our findings

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Patients with coronavirus disease vaccine associated
               lymphadenopathy are increasingly being referred to healthcare
               services. This work is the first to report on the incidence,
               clinical course and imaging features of coronavirus disease
               vaccine associated cervical lymphadenopathy, with special
               emphasis on the implications for head and neck cancer services.
               METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients
               referred to our head and neck cancer clinics between 16 December
               2020 and 12 March 2021. The main outcomes measured were the
               proportion of patients with vaccine-associated cervical
               lymphadenopathy, and the clinical and imaging characteristics.
               RESULTS: The incidence of vaccine-associated cervical
               lymphadenopathy referrals was 14.8 per cent (n = 13). Five
               patients (38.5 per cent) had abnormal-looking enlarged and
               rounded nodes with increased vascularity. Only seven patients
               (53.9 per cent) reported full resolution within an average of
               3.1 $\pm$ 2.3 weeks. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease vaccine
               associated cervical lymphadenopathy can mimic malignant
               lymphadenopathy and therefore might prove challenging to
               diagnose and manage correctly. Healthcare services may encounter
               a significant increase in referrals.",

               psychological distress. Design: Cross-sectional study.
               Setting/Subjects: Physicians, advance practice providers,
               nurses, and case managers at two hospitals. Measurements:
               Seventeen-item questionnaire on demographics, contributions of
               PC, and psychological distress. Results: Of 427 health
               professionals invited to participate, 76 responded (18\%). Among
               64 eligible respondents, 72\% were female, 56\% were under the
               age 40, 40.6\% were nurses, 28.1\% were physicians, and 66\%

               plasma itself, the timing of administration and the clinical
               aspects of the recipients. SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to be
               associated with an increase in the blood concentrations of
               several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, as part of the

  abstract  = "The first quarter of the 21st century has remarkably been
               characterized by a multitude of challenges confronting human
               society as a whole in terms of several outbreaks of infectious
               viral diseases, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory
               syndrome (SARS), China; the 2009 influenza H1N1, Mexico; the
               2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Saudi Arabia; and
               the ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), China. COVID-19,
               caused by SARS-CoV-2, reportedly broke out in December 2019,
               Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and continues
               unabated, leading to considerable devastation and death
               worldwide. The most common target organ of SARS-CoV-2 is the
               lungs, especially the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells,
               culminating in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in
               severe patients. Nevertheless, other tissues and organs are also
               known to be critically affected following infection, thereby
               complicating the overall aetiology and prognosis. Excluding
               H1N1, the SARS-CoV (also referred as SARS-CoV-1), MERS, and
               SARS-CoV-2 are collectively referred to as coronaviruses, and
               taxonomically placed under the realm Riboviria, order
               Nidovirales, suborder Cornidovirineae, family Coronaviridae,
               subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus, and
               subgenus Sarbecovirus. As of 23 September 2021, the ongoing
               SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has globally resulted in around 229 million
               and 4.7 million reported infections and deaths, respectively,
               apart from causing huge psychosomatic debilitation, academic
               loss, and deep economic recession. Such an unprecedented
               pandemic has compelled researchers, especially epidemiologists
               and immunologists, to search for SARS-CoV-2-associated potential
               immunogenic molecules to develop a vaccine as an immediate
               prophylactic measure. Amongst multiple structural and
               non-structural proteins, the homotrimeric spike (S) glycoprotein
               has been empirically found as the most suitable candidate for
               vaccine development owing to its immense immunogenic potential,
               which makes it capable of eliciting both humoral and
               cell-mediated immune responses. As a consequence, it has become
               possible to design appropriate, safe, and effective vaccines,
               apart from related therapeutic agents, to reduce both morbidity
               and mortality. As of 23 September 2021, four vaccines, namely,
               Comirnaty, COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, Spikevax, and Vaxzevria,
               have received the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) approval,
               and around thirty are under the phase three clinical trial with
               emergency authorization by the vaccine-developing
               country-specific National Regulatory Authority (NRA). In
               addition, 100-150 vaccines are under various phases of
               pre-clinical and clinical trials. The mainstay of global
               vaccination is to introduce herd immunity, which would protect
               the majority of the population, including immunocompromised
               individuals, from infection and disease. Here, we primarily
               discuss category-wise vaccine development, their respective
               advantages and disadvantages, associated efficiency and
               potential safety aspects, antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 structural
               proteins and immune responses to them along with the emergence
               of SARS-CoV-2 VOC, and the urgent need of achieving herd
               immunity to contain the pandemic.",

               changes in the delivery of healthcare worldwide. Our oncology
               service (at an Irish national cancer centre) rapidly
               transitioned to the use of telemedicine or virtual clinics (VC)
               to minimise potential risk of exposure to COVID-19 amongst an
               immunosuppressed, high-risk population. Our study aimed to
               evaluate the use of VC in this setting. METHODS: An 18-point
               questionnaire was designed to investigate the patient experience
               of VC during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland and compliance
               with guidelines developed in Ireland to conduct VC and the role
               of VC in the future. Questionnaires were distributed following
               the receipt of verbal consent from patients during the VC.
               Descriptive statistics were utilised for data analysis using
               SPSS\textregistered{}. RESULTS: One hundred and four patients
               returned completed surveys (n = 104/164, 63\% response rate).
               Overall satisfaction levels were high with most patients (n =

               or nearly equally satisfied with VC in comparison to a usual
               clinic encounter. The majority of patients felt that there
               should be a role for VC in the future (n = 84/102, 82\%; NAP, n
               = 2). The majority of patients (n = 61/99, 61\%; NAP, n = 5)
               were very relieved to avoid a hospital visit due to perceived
               risk of potential exposure to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority

               patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia and the risk factors for
               these residual lung abnormalities. METHODS: In total, 141
               COVID-19 patients were assigned to group 1 (diabetes), group 2
               (secondary hyperglycemia) or group 3 (controls). Initial and
               six- and twelve-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans
               were performed 16 days, 175 days and 351 days after symptom
               onset, respectively. CT findings and clinical and peak
               laboratory parameters were collected and compared. Univariable
               and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to
               identify the independent predictors for the presence of residual
               lung abnormalities at the 6-month follow-up exam. Seven
               variables (age; the presence of acute respiratory distress
               syndrome; the duration of hospitalization; the peak levels of
               lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein; and the
               initial total CT score) were chosen in the final multivariable
               models. RESULTS: At the six-month follow-up, abnormalities were
               still observed on chest CT in 77/141 (54.6\%) patients.
               Reticular patterns (40/141, 28.4\%) and ground-glass opacities
               (GGOs) (29/141, 20.6\%) were the most common CT abnormalities on
               the follow-up CT scans. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 had
               significantly higher incidences of residual lung abnormalities
               than those in Group 3 (65.4\% and 58.3\%, respectively vs.
               36.6\%; p 20 days (OR: 5.630, 95\% CI: 1.394-22.744, p = 0.015),
               an LDH level $\geq$ 317 U/L (OR: 7.020, 95\% CI: 1.032-47.743, p

               1.378-71.415, p = 0.023) were independent predictors of residual
               pulmonary abnormalities in patients with diabetes or secondary
               hyperglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of
               surviving COVID-19 patients with diabetes or secondary
               hyperglycemia had residual pulmonary abnormalities six months
               after disease onset, and we found evidence of persistent chest
               CT changes at the one-year follow-up. Residual lung
               abnormalities were associated with longer hospital stays, higher
               peak LDH levels and higher initial total CT scores.",

               have been shown to play an intricate role in the progression of
               both solid and haematological malignancies. Recent studies have
               shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a worse outcome in
               cancer patients, especially in haematological malignancy
               patients. Here, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts
               the already altered CCG levels in solid or haematological
               malignancies, specifically, whether there is a protective effect
               or rather a potentially higher risk for major COVID-19
               complications in cancer patients due to elevated CCGs linked to
               cancer progression. Serially analysing immune responses with 55
               CCGs in cancer patients under active treatment with or without
               SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first showed that cancer patients
               without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 54) demonstrate elevated
               levels of 35 CCGs compared to the non-cancer, non-infected
               control group of health care workers (n = 42). Of the 35 CCGs,
               19 were common to both the solid and haematological malignancy
               groups and comprised previously described cytokines such as
               IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1Ra, IL-17A, and VEGF, but also several
               less well described cytokines/chemokines such as Fractalkine,
               Tie-2, and T cell chemokine CTACK. Importantly, we show here
               that 7 CCGs are significantly altered in SARS-CoV-2 exposed
               cancer patients (n = 52). Of these, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\beta$,
               TSLP, and sVCAM-1, identified to be elevated in haematological
               cancers, are also known tumour-promoting factors. Longitudinal
               analysis conducted over 3 months showed persistence of several
               tumour-promoting CCGs in SARS-CoV-2 exposed cancer patients.
               These data demonstrate a need for increased vigilance for

               we must continue to develop our understanding of the nature of
               the disease and its effects on human immunity. Previously, we
               suggested that a dysregulated STAT3 pathway following SARS-Co-2
               infection ultimately leads to PAI-1 activation and cascades of
               pathologies. The major COVID-19-associated metabolic risks (old
               age, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and
               obesity) share high PAI-1 levels and could predispose certain
               groups to severe COVID-19 complications. In this review article,
               we describe the common metabolic profile that is shared between
               all of these high-risk groups and COVID-19. This profile not
               only involves high levels of PAI-1 and STAT3 as previously
               described, but also includes low levels of glutamine and NAD+,
               coupled with overproduction of hyaluronan (HA). SARS-CoV-2
               infection exacerbates this metabolic imbalance and predisposes
               these patients to the severe pathophysiologies of COVID-19,
               including the involvement of NETs (neutrophil extracellular
               traps) and HA overproduction in the lung. While
               hyperinflammation due to proinflammatory cytokine overproduction
               has been frequently documented, it is recently recognized that
               the immune response is markedly suppressed in some cases by the
               expansion and activity of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor
               cells) and FoxP3+ Tregs (regulatory T cells). The metabolomics
               profiles of severe COVID-19 patients and patients with advanced
               cancer are similar, and in high-risk patients, SARS-CoV-2
               infection leads to aberrant STAT3 activation, which promotes a
               cancer-like metabolism. We propose that glutamine deficiency and
               overproduced HA is the central metabolic characteristic of
               COVID-19 and its high-risk groups. We suggest the usage of
               glutamine supplementation and the repurposing of cancer drugs to
               prevent the development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.",

               team. RESULTS: During the study period 59 patients were
               recruited, median age of 70 years, 57.6\% females. The primary
               diagnosis was severe COVID-19 (50.8\%), advanced cancer (32.2\%)
               and advanced chronic illness (16.9\%). A total of 211 telehealth
               sessions were carried out, 82\% psychological and 18\%
               spiritual. The main criteria for psychological sessions were
               being related to seriously ill patients with withdrawal or
               withholding of life-support treatment (60.1\%). The main
               criteria for spiritual sessions were being a patient with
               spiritual suffering or requesting spiritual assistance (73.6\%).
               An electronic user satisfaction survey indicated high
               satisfaction rates. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates that it
               is possible to provide spiritual and psychological palliative

               immune response seen on FDG PET studies. However, the time

               temporal metabolic response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in
               oncology patients undergoing standard of care FDG PET. METHODS:
               262 oncology patients undergoing standard of care FDG PET were
               included in the analysis. 231 patients had at least one dose of
               mRNA COVID-19 vaccine while 31 patients had not been vaccinated.
               The SUVmax of the lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccination was
               compared to the contralateral to obtain an absolute change in
               SUVmax ($\Delta$SUVmax). RESULTS: $\Delta$SUVmax was more
               significant at shorter times between FDG PET imaging and
               COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with a median $\Delta$SUVmax of 2.6

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemics required changes in medical
               practices. In thoracic oncology, pembrolizumab was doubled to
               400mg every 6weeks, nivolumab to 480mg every 4weeks. The
               objective of our study was to assess the impact on quality of
               life, and on psychological state, as well as the tolerance, of
               this new schedule. METHODS: Thoracic oncologic patients who
               underwent these therapeutic changes in our center during the
               first COVID-19 epidemic wave were included. Their quality of
               life was assessed using the Quality of Life Questionnaire-30,
               their psychological state by the Hospital Anxiety Depression
               (HAD) scale. We also reported the preferred administration
               schedule, as well as adverse events. RESULTS: Thirty patients
               were included. The overall quality of life was preserved. Rates
               on HAD scale were low. Tolerance was acceptable. In majority,
               patients preferred the new procedure. They had a significantly

               with COVID-19-convalescent plasmas, neither appropriate approach

               efficacy of administration of highly-neutralizing
               COVID-19-convalescent plasma (hn-plasmas) and such
               plasma-derived IgG administration using the Syrian hamster
               COVID-19 model. Two hn-plasmas, which were in the best 1\% of
               340 neutralizing-activity-determined convalescent plasma
               samples, were intraperitoneally administered to
               SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, resulting in significant reduction
               of viral titers in lungs by up to 32-fold as compared to the
               viral titers in hamsters receiving control non-neutralizing
               plasma, while with two moderately neutralizing plasmas
               (mn-plasmas) administered, viral titer reduction was by up to
               6-fold. IgG fractions purified from the two hn-plasmas also
               reduced viral titers in lungs than those from the two
               mn-plasmas. The severity of lung lesions seen in hamsters
               receiving hn-plasmas was minimal to moderate as assessed using
               micro-computerized tomography, which histological examination
               confirmed. Western blotting revealed that all four
               COVID-19-convalescent-plasmas variably contained antibodies
               against SARS-CoV-2 components including the receptor-binding
               domain and S1 domain. The present data strongly suggest that
               administering potent-neutralizing-activity-confirmed
               COVID-19-convalescent plasmas would be efficacious in treating
               patients with COVID-19. Importance Convalescent plasmas obtained
               from patients, who recovered from a specific infection, have
               been used as agents to treat other patients infected with the
               very pathogen. To treat using convalescent plasmas, despite that
               more than 10 randomized-controlled-clinical-trials have been
               conducted and more than 100 studies are currently ongoing, the
               effects of convalescent plasma against COVID-19 remained
               uncertain. On the other hand, certain COVID-19 vaccines have
               been shown to reduce the clinical COVID-19 onset by 94-95\%, for
               which the elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are
               apparently directly responsible. Here, we demonstrate that
               highly-neutralizing-effect-confirmed convalescent plasmas
               significantly reduce the viral titers in the lung of
               SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamsters and block the development of
               virally-induced lung lesions. The present data provide a
               proof-of-concept that the presence of highly-neutralizing
               antibody in COVID-19-convalescent plasmas is directly
               responsible for the reduction of viral replication and support
               the use of highly-neutralizing antibody-containing plasmas in

               vasopressors and sedatives dosages immediately following the

               COVID-19 patients, 19 of them (50\%) underwent tracheostomy
               within 7 days of intubation (early tracheostomy group) and the
               rest underwent tracheostomy after 8 days or more (late
               tracheostomy group). RESULTS: Decannulation rates were
               significantly higher while mortality rates were
               non-significantly lower in the early tracheostomy group compared
               with the late tracheostomy group (58\% vs 21\% p < 0.05; 42\% vs
               74\% p = 0.1, respectively). Tidal volume increased (446 ml vs

  abstract  = "BackgroundThere is considerable variability in COVID-19 outcomes
               among younger adults, and some of this variation may be due to
               genetic predisposition.MethodsWe combined individual level data
               from 13,888 COVID-19 patients (n = 7185 hospitalized) from 17
               cohorts in 9 countries to assess the association of the major
               common COVID-19 genetic risk factor (chromosome 3 locus tagged
               by rs10490770) with mortality, COVID-19-related complications,
               and laboratory values. We next performed metaanalyses using
               FinnGen and the Columbia University COVID-19 Biobank.ResultsWe
               found that rs10490770 risk allele carriers experienced an
               increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.4; 95\% CI,
               1.2-1.7). Risk allele carriers had increased odds of several
               COVID-19 complications: severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.1;
               95\% CI, 1.6-2.6), venous thromboembolism (OR, 1.7; 95\% CI,
               1.2-2.4), and hepatic injury (OR, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.2-2.0). Risk
               allele carriers age 60 years and younger had higher odds of
               death or severe respiratory failure (OR, 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.8-3.9)
               compared with those of more than 60 years (OR, 1.5; 95\% CI,
               1.2-1.8; interaction, P = 0.038). Among individuals 60 years and
               younger who died or experienced severe respiratory failure,
               32.3\% were risk-variant carriers compared with 13.9\% of those
               not experiencing these outcomes. This risk variant improved the
               prediction of death or severe respiratory failure similarly to,
               or better than, most established clinical risk
               factors.ConclusionsThe major common COVID-19 genetic risk factor
               is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality,
               which are more pronounced among individuals 60 years or younger.
               The effect was similar in magnitude and more common than most

               bridge surgery delay of weeks to months for patients with
               hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer during the ongoing
               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The effects of NET
               of varying durations on pathologic response are unclear. Using
               the National Cancer Database (NCDB), we evaluated objective
               response to short ( 27 weeks) duration of NET. PATIENTS AND
               METHODS: The study cohort included female patients diagnosed
               with nonmetastatic invasive HR+ breast cancer, stratifying by
               those who received NET versus no NET between 2004 and 2016.
               Pathologic response was grouped into four categories (complete,
               downstaged, stable, upstaged) by comparing clinical and
               pathologic staging data. Objective response to NET included
               complete, downstaged, and stable pathologic response. Clinical
               characteristics were compared using $\chi$2 and analysis of
               variance (ANOVA) tests. Multivariable logistic regression was
               used to determine factors associated with NET use and objective
               response according to NET duration. RESULTS: A minority (1.2\%)
               received NET in our cohort. Factors associated with NET use
               included older age, non-Black patients, more advanced clinical
               stage, higher comorbidity score, government insurance, and
               lobular histology. Objective response rate (ORR) was 56.7\%,
               52.1\%, and 49.0\% after short, moderate, and long NET duration,
               respectively. CONCLUSION: Short NET duration did not result in
               an inferior ORR. Future study to evaluate the interaction
               between surgery delay and NET use on clinical outcome will
               provide insights into the safety of NET to bridge potential

               COVID-19-related lockdowns on sleep quality across global
               populations. However, no study to date has specifically assessed
               at-risk populations, particularly those at highest risk of
               complications from coronavirus infection deemed
               ``clinically-extremely-vulnerable-(COVID-19CEV)'' (as defined by
               Public Health England). Methods: In this cross-sectional study,
               we surveyed 5,558 adults aged $\geq$50 years (of whom 523 met
               criteria for COVID-19CEV) during the first pandemic wave that
               resulted in a nationwide-lockdown (April-June 2020) with
               assessments of sleep quality (an adapted sleep scale that
               captured multiple sleep indices before and during the lockdown),
               health/medical, lifestyle, psychosocial and socio-demographic
               factors. We examined associations between these variables and
               sleep quality; and explored interactions of COVID-19CEV status
               with significant predictors of poor sleep, to identify potential
               moderating factors. Results: Thirty-seven percent of
               participants reported poor sleep quality which was associated
               with younger age, female sex and multimorbidity. Significant
               associations with poor sleep included health/medical factors:
               COVID-19CEV status, higher BMI, arthritis, pulmonary disease,
               and mental health disorders; and the following lifestyle and
               psychosocial factors: living alone, higher alcohol consumption,
               an unhealthy diet and higher depressive and anxiety symptoms.
               Moderators of the negative relationship between COVID-19CEV
               status and good sleep quality were marital status, loneliness,
               anxiety and diet. Within this subgroup, less anxious and less
               lonely males, as well as females with healthier diets, reported
               better sleep. Conclusions: Sleep quality in older adults was
               compromised during the sudden unprecedented nation-wide lockdown
               due to distinct modifiable factors. An important contribution of
               our study is the assessment of a
               ``clinically-extremely-vulnerable'' population and the sex
               differences identified within this group. Male and female older
               adults deemed COVID-19CEV may benefit from targeted mental
               health and dietary interventions, respectively. This work
               extends the available evidence on the notable impact of lack of
               social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, and
               provides recommendations toward areas for future work, including
               research into vulnerability factors impacting sleep disruption
               and COVID-19-related complications. Study results may inform
               tailored interventions targeted at modifiable risk factors to
               promote optimal sleep; additionally, providing empirical data to

               recent pandemic of COVID-19 has led to severe morbidity and

              presence and magnitude of associations between ethnic groups and
              COVID-19-related outcomes. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were
              searched from December 2019 through September 2020. Studies
              reporting extractable data (ie, crude numbers, and unadjusted or
              adjusted risk/ORs) by ethnic group on any of the five studied
              outcomes: confirmed COVID-19 infection in the general population,
              hospitalisation among infected patients, and disease severity,
              intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality among
              hospitalised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were included
              using standardised electronic data extraction forms. We pooled
              data from published studies using random-effects meta-analysis.
              RESULTS: 58 studies were included from seven countries in four
              continents, mostly retrospective cohort studies, covering a total
              of almost 10 million individuals from the first wave until the
              summer of 2020. The risk of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection was
              higher in most ethnic minority groups than their White
              counterparts in North American and Europe with the differences
              remaining in the US ethnic minorities after adjustment for
              confounders and explanatory factors. Among people with confirmed
              infection, African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans were also
              more likely than White-Americans to be hospitalised with
              SARS-CoV-2 infection. No increased risk of COVID-19 outcomes (ie,
              severe disease, ICU admission and death) was found among ethnic
              minority patients once hospitalised, except for a higher risk of
              death among ethnic minorities in Brazil. CONCLUSION: The risk of
              SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was higher in most ethnic minorities, but
              once hospitalised, no clear inequalities exist in COVID-19
              outcomes except for the high risk of death in ethnic minorities

               the cancer status. Triage was supported by risk stratification
               using a validated calculator. RESULTS: Data for 4568 cases were
               submitted by 41 centers serving a population of approximately 26
               million. These represented 14.1\% of the predicted maximum
               referrals for this population outside of pandemic times, and
               this gave the study a margin of error of 1.34\% at 95\%
               confidence. Completed 6-month follow-up data were available for
               99.8\% with an overall cancer rate of 5.6\% (254 of 4557). The
               rates of triage were as follows: urgent imaging investigation,
               25.4\% (n = 1156); urgent face-to-face review, 27.8\%; (n =
               1268); assessment deferral, 30.3\% (n = 1382); and discharge,
               16.4\% (n = 749). The corresponding missed cancers rates were
               0.5\% (5 of 1048), 0.3\% (3 of 1149), 0.9\% (12 of 1382), and
               0.9\% (7 of 747; P = .15). The negative predictive value for a
               nonurgent triage outcome and no cancer diagnosis was 99.1\%.
               Overall harm was reported in 0.24\% (11 of 4557) and was highest
               for deferred assessments (0.58\%; 8 of 1382). CONCLUSIONS:
               Remote triage, incorporating risk stratification, may facilitate
               targeted investigations for higher risk patients and prevent
               unnecessary hospital attendance for lower risk patients. The
               risk of harm is low and may be reduced further with appropriate
               safety netting of deferred appointments. LAY SUMMARY: This large
               national study observed the widespread adoption of telephone
               assessment (supported by a risk calculator) of patients referred
               to hospital specialists with suspected head and neck cancer
               during the initial peak of the coronavirus disease 2019
               pandemic. The authors identified 4568 patients from 41 UK
               centers (serving a population of more than 26 million people)
               who were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Late cancers
               were identified, whether reviewed or investigated urgently
               (0.4\%) or nonurgently (0.9\%), but the overall rate of harm was
               low (0.2\%), with the highest rate being seen with deferred
               appointments (0.6\%).",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The development of severe coronavirus disease 2019
               (COVID-19) and poor clinical outcomes are associated with
               hyperinflammation and a complex dysregulation of the immune
               response. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory medicine and is
               thought to improve disease outcomes in COVID-19 through a wide
               range of anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Patients and healthcare
               systems need more and better treatment options for COVID-19 and
               a thorough understanding of the current body of evidence.
               OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of Colchicine
               as a treatment option for COVID-19 in comparison to an active
               comparator, placebo, or standard care alone in any setting, and
               to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living
               systematic review approach. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
               Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (comprising CENTRAL, MEDLINE
               (PubMed), Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical
               Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science
               Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index),
               and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to
               identify completed and ongoing studies without language
               restrictions to 21 May 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included
               randomised controlled trials evaluating colchicine for the
               treatment of people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease
               severity, age, sex, or ethnicity. We excluded studies
               investigating the prophylactic effects of colchicine for people
               without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2) infection but at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure.
               DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane
               methodology. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) to
               assess bias in included studies and GRADE to rate the certainty
               of evidence for the following prioritised outcome categories
               considering people with moderate or severe COVID-19: all-cause
               mortality, worsening and improvement of clinical status, quality
               of life, adverse events, and serious adverse events and for
               people with asymptomatic infection or mild disease: all-cause
               mortality, admission to hospital or death, symptom resolution,
               duration to symptom resolution, quality of life, adverse events,
               serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included three RCTs
               with 11,525 hospitalised participants (8002 male) and one RCT
               with 4488 (2067 male) non-hospitalised participants. Mean age of
               people treated in hospital was about 64 years, and was 55 years
               in the study with non-hospitalised participants. Further, we
               identified 17 ongoing studies and 11 studies completed or
               terminated, but without published results. Colchicine plus
               standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo)
               Treatment of hospitalised people with moderate to severe
               COVID-19 All-cause mortality: colchicine plus standard care
               probably results in little to no difference in all-cause
               mortality up to 28 days compared to standard care alone (risk
               ratio (RR) 1.00, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.08; 2
               RCTs, 11,445 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
               Worsening of clinical status: colchicine plus standard care
               probably results in little to no difference in worsening of
               clinical status assessed as new need for invasive mechanical
               ventilation or death compared to standard care alone (RR 1.02,
               95\% CI 0.96 to 1.09; 2 RCTs, 10,916 participants;
               moderate-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical status:
               colchicine plus standard care probably results in little to no
               difference in improvement of clinical status, assessed as number
               of participants discharged alive up to day 28 without clinical
               deterioration or death compared to standard care alone (RR 0.99,
               95\% CI 0.96 to 1.01; 1 RCT, 11,340 participants;
               moderate-certainty evidence). Quality of life, including fatigue
               and neurological status: we identified no studies reporting this
               outcome. Adverse events: the evidence is very uncertain about
               the effect of colchicine on adverse events compared to placebo
               (RR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.56 to 1.78; 1 RCT, 72 participants; very
               low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events: the evidence is
               very uncertain about the effect of colchicine plus standard care
               on serious adverse events compared to standard care alone (0
               events observed in 1 RCT of 105 participants; very low-certainty
               evidence). Treatment of non-hospitalised people with
               asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19 All-cause
               mortality: the evidence is uncertain about the effect of
               colchicine on all-cause mortality at 28 days (Peto odds ratio
               (OR) 0.57, 95\% CI 0.20 to 1.62; 1 RCT, 4488 participants;
               low-certainty evidence). Admission to hospital or death within
               28 days: colchicine probably slightly reduces the need for
               hospitalisation or death within 28 days compared to placebo (RR
               0.80, 95\% CI 0.62 to 1.03; 1 RCT, 4488 participants;
               moderate-certainty evidence). Symptom resolution: we identified
               no studies reporting this outcome. Quality of life, including
               fatigue and neurological status: we identified no studies
               reporting this outcome. Adverse events: the evidence is
               uncertain about the effect of colchicine on adverse events
               compared to placebo . Results are from one RCT reporting
               treatment-related events only in 4412 participants
               (low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events: colchicine
               probably slightly reduces serious adverse events (RR 0.78, 95\%
               CI 0.61 to 1.00; 1 RCT, 4412 participants; moderate-certainty
               evidence). Colchicine versus another active treatment (e.g.
               corticosteroids, anti-viral drugs, monoclonal antibodies) No
               studies evaluated this comparison. Different formulations,
               doses, or schedules of colchicine No studies assessed this.
               AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current evidence, in people
               hospitalised with moderate to severe COVID-19 the use of
               colchicine probably has little to no influence on mortality or
               clinical progression in comparison to placebo or standard care
               alone. We do not know whether colchicine increases the risk of
               (serious) adverse events. We are uncertain about the evidence of
               the effect of colchicine on all-cause mortality for people with
               asymptomatic infection or mild disease. However, colchicine
               probably results in a slight reduction of hospital admissions or
               deaths within 28 days, and the rate of serious adverse events
               compared with placebo. None of the studies reported data on
               quality of life or compared the benefits and harms of colchicine
               versus other drugs, or different dosages of colchicine. We
               identified 17 ongoing and 11 completed but not published RCTs,
               which we expect to incorporate in future versions of this review
               as their results become available. Editorial note: due to the
               living approach of this work, we monitor newly published results
               of RCTs on colchicine on a weekly basis and will update the
               review when the evidence or our certainty in the evidence
               changes.",

               and anti-inflammatory properties are being investigated in
               clinical trials as treatment for COVID-19. The use of
               antibiotics follows the intention-to-treat the viral disease and
               not primarily to treat bacterial co-infections of individuals
               with COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence
               regarding effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as anti-viral
               treatments for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials
               (RCTs) is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and
               safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment,
               standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active
               intervention with proven efficacy for treatment of COVID-19
               outpatients and inpatients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the
               Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase,
               ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science
               and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to
               identify completed and ongoing studies to 14 June 2021.
               SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs were included that compared antibiotics
               with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo,
               or another proven intervention, for treatment of people with
               confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in
               the in- or outpatient settings. Co-interventions had to be the
               same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing
               antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven
               efficacy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed risk of bias
               of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2)
               for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for
               the following primary outcomes: 1. to treat inpatients with
               moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening
               defined as new need for intubation or death, clinical
               improvement defined as being discharged alive, quality of life,
               adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias; 2.
               to treat outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19:
               mortality, clinical worsening defined as hospital admission or
               death, clinical improvement defined as symptom resolution,
               quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac
               arrhythmias. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies with 11,281
               participants with an average age of 54 years investigating
               antibiotics compared to placebo, standard of care alone or
               another antibiotic. No study was found comparing antibiotics to
               an intervention with proven efficacy. All studies investigated
               azithromycin, two studies investigated other antibiotics
               compared to azithromycin. Seven studies investigated inpatients
               with moderate to severe COVID-19 and four investigated mild
               COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings. Eight studies had an
               open-label design, two were blinded with a placebo control, and
               one did not report on blinding. We identified 19 ongoing and 15
               studies awaiting classification pending publication of results
               or clarification of inconsistencies. Of the 30 study results
               contributing to primary outcomes by included studies, 17 were
               assessed as overall low risk and 13 as some concerns of bias.
               Only studies investigating azithromycin reported data eligible
               for the prioritised primary outcomes. Azithromycin doses and
               treatment duration varied among included studies. Azithromycin
               for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of
               care alone in inpatients We are very certain that azithromycin
               has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28
               compared to standard of care alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95\%
               confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; 8600 participants; 4
               studies; high-certainty evidence). Azithromycin probably has
               little or no effect on clinical worsening or death at day 28 (RR
               0.95; 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 7311 participants; 1 study;
               moderate-certainty evidence), on clinical improvement at day 28
               (RR 0.96; 95\% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 8172 participants; 3 studies;
               moderate-certainty evidence), on serious adverse events during
               the study period (RR 1.11; 95\% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 794
               participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and
               cardiac arrhythmias during the study period (RR 0.92; 95\% CI
               0.73 to 1.15; 7865 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty
               evidence) compared to placebo or standard of care alone.
               Azithromycin may increase any adverse events slightly during the
               study period (RR 1.20; 95\% CI 0.92 to 1.57; 355 participants; 3
               studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to standard of care
               alone. No study reported quality of life up to 28 days.
               Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo
               or standard of care alone in outpatients Azithromycin may have
               little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care
               alone on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 1.00 ; 95\% CI 0.06
               to 15.69; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence),
               on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.94 ; 95\%
               CI 0.57 to 1.56; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty
               evidence), and on symptom resolution at day 14 (RR 1.03; 95\% CI
               0.95 to 1.12; 138 participants; 1 study; low-certainty
               evidence). We are uncertain whether azithromycin increases or
               reduces serious adverse events compared to placebo or standard
               of care alone (0 participants experienced serious adverse
               events; 454 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty
               evidence). No study reported on adverse events, cardiac
               arrhythmias during the study period or quality of life up to 28
               days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to any
               other antibiotics in inpatients and outpatients One study
               compared azithromycin to lincomycin in inpatients, but did not
               report any primary outcome. Another study compared azithromycin
               to clarithromycin in outpatients, but did not report any
               relevant outcome for this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are
               certain that risk of death in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is
               not reduced by treatment with azithromycin after 28 days.
               Further, based on moderate-certainty evidence, patients in the
               inpatient setting with moderate and severe disease probably do
               not benefit from azithromycin used as potential antiviral and
               anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 regarding clinical
               worsening or improvement. For the outpatient setting, there is
               currently low-certainty evidence that azithromycin may have no

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In response to the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)
               pandemic, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency
               in Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka
               prefectures on April 7, 2020; this was extended to the remaining
               prefectures on April 16, 2020. The state of emergency was lifted
               on May 25, 2020. Although it was known that breast cancer
               screening was postponed or canceled during this period, the
               actual extent of postponement or cancellation has not been
               clarified. METHODS: We investigated postponement or cancellation
               of breast cancer screening between April and May 2020 using a
               cross-sectional, web-based, self-reported questionnaire survey.
               In addition, we examined the association between socioeconomic
               and health-related factors and postponement or cancellation by
               multivariable log-binominal regression. RESULTS: Among 1874
               women aged 30-79 years who had scheduled breast cancer screening
               during the study period, 493 women (26.3\%) postponed or
               canceled screening. While women aged 30-39 years and 70-79 years
               postponed or canceled less frequently than women aged 40-49
               years (prevalence ratio = 0.62 and 0.56, respectively), there
               was no significant difference between age groups in the women
               aged 40-69 years. Postponement or cancellation was more frequent
               in five prefectures, where the state of emergency was declared
               early (prevalence ratio = 1.25). Employment status, annual
               household income, family structure, academic background, smoking
               status, and fear of COVID-19 were not associated with
               postponement or cancellation. CONCLUSION: Although care should
               be taken with the interpretation of these findings due to
               possible biases, they suggest that the postponement or
               cancellation of breast cancer screening might be due more to
               facility suspension than to individual factors. It is necessary
               to explore the ideal way of encouraging breast cancer screening

               repurposed FDA-approved drugs to treat COVID-19's clinical
               manifestations was developed. SARS-CoV-2 interacting human
               proteins and GWAS identified respiratory failure genes provide
               the input from which the mode-of-action (MOA) proteins/pathways
               of the resulting disease comorbidities are predicted. These

               To assess each manifestation's molecular basis, their
               prioritized shared proteins were subject to global pathway

               median age = 69.5 years; n = 7 control, median age = 68 years)

               Strikingly, neurological symptoms were exclusive to, and

               to be evaluated. METHODS: We assessed 39 patients [age: 64
               y(60.1-68.7)] with confirmed SARS CoV-2 pneumonia. A total of 24
               patients were hospitalized until the follow-up test, 9 were

               unit. Two ultrasound scans of the lung were performed on day 1
               and 4 of patients' hospitalization. Primary endpoint was the

               compared with the previous 5 years. A retrospective
               observational cohort study of all children (0-15 years)
               attending for urgent care across Oxfordshire, during the first
               UK lockdown in 2020, compared to matched dates in 2015-2019,
               across two paediatric hospitals providing secondary care,
               including one with tertiary services. Our outcome measures were
               changes in numbers of patients attending and inpatient diagnoses
               (using ICD-10 classification) during the first 2020 lockdown,
               compared with the previous 5 years, were used. We found that
               total Emergency Department (ED) attendances (n = 4030) and
               hospital admissions (n = 1416) during the first UK lockdown were
               reduced by 56.8\% and 59.4\%, respectively, compared to
               2015-2019 (5-year means n = 7446.8 and n = 2491.6,
               respectively). Proportions of patients admitted from ED and
               length of stay were similar across 2015-2020. ICD-10 diagnoses
               in lockdown of 2020 (n = 2843) versus matched 2015-2019 dates (n
               = 19,946) demonstrated significantly greater neoplasm diagnoses
               (p = 0.0123). Of diagnoses 'missing' in lockdown, 80\% were
               categorised as infectious diseases or their sequelae and 20\%
               were non-specific pains/aches/malaise and accidental
               injury/poisonings.Conclusions: Pandemic public health measures
               significantly altered paediatric presentations. Oxfordshire
               hospitals had a 58\% reduction in ED attendances/inpatient
               admissions, with 'missing' diagnoses predominantly
               infection-related illnesses. These are likely driven by a
               combination of the following: (1) public health infection
               control measures successfully reducing disease transmission, (2)
               parents/carers keeping mild/self-limiting disease at home, and
               (3) pandemic-related healthcare anxieties. Prospective studies
               are needed to ensure referral pathways identify vulnerable
               children, those with social concerns, and avoid delayed
               presentation. What is Known: • Significant reductions of
               paediatric ED attendances and inpatient admissions are reported
               globally, throughout national and regional lockdowns for
               COVID-19. • Previous studies (supplemental table 5) examined
               only ED diagnoses or specific inpatient diagnoses during
               lockdown periods, demonstrating reductions of infectious
               diseases, accidents/injuries, and safeguarding referrals. What
               is New: • Using ICD-10 coding, robustly controlling for five
               historical years and adopting a hypothesis-independent analysis,
               demonstrating 80\% of 'missing' inpatient diagnoses during
               national COVID-19 lockdown were infectious diseases or its
               sequelae, the remainder being non-specific aches/pains/malaise
               and accidental injuries/poisonings. • Greater numbers of
               neoplasms and other specific diagnoses were detected during
               lockdown, including greater documentation of co-morbidities and

               supplies pediatric oncologists with data surrounding the
               clinical course and outcomes in children with cancer and
               SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This observational study captured clinical
               and sociodemographic characteristics for children ($\leq$ 21
               years) receiving cancer therapy and infected with SARS-CoV-2
               from the pandemic onset through February 19, 2021. The
               demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort were
               compared with population-level pediatric oncology data (SEER).
               Multivariable binomial regression models evaluated patient
               characteristics associated with hospitalization, intensive care
               unit (ICU) admission, and changes in cancer therapy. RESULTS:
               Ninety-four institutions contributed details on 917 children
               with cancer and SARS-CoV-2. Median age at SARS-CoV-2 infection
               was 11 years (range, 0-21 years). Compared with SEER, there was
               an over-representation of Hispanics (43.6\% v 29.7\%, P < .01),
               publicly insured (59.3\% v 33.5\%, P < .01), and patients with
               hematologic malignancies (65.8\% v 38.3\%, P < .01) in our
               cohort. The majority (64.1\%) were symptomatic; 31.2\% were
               hospitalized, 10.9\% required respiratory support, 9.2\% were
               admitted to the ICU, and 1.6\% died because of SARS-CoV-2.
               Cancer therapy was modified in 44.9\%. Hispanic ethnicity was
               associated with changes in cancer-directed therapy (adjusted
               risk ratio [aRR] = 1.3; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.6]). Presence of
               comorbidities was associated with hospitalization (aRR = 1.3;
               95\% CI, 1.1 to 1.6) and ICU admission (aRR = 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.5
               to 3.6). Hematologic malignancies were associated with
               hospitalization (aRR = 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 2.1). CONCLUSION:
               These findings provide critical information for decision making
               among pediatric oncologists, including inpatient versus
               outpatient management, cancer therapy modifications,
               consideration of monoclonal antibody therapy, and counseling
               families on infection risks in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2
               pandemic. The over-representation of Hispanic and publicly
               insured patients in this national cohort suggests disparities

               baseline chronic conditions, associated with an increased risk
               of severity in COVID-19 patients from a population-based
               perspective and using data from electronic health records (EHR).
               METHODS: Retrospective, observational study in an open cohort
               analyzing all 68,913 individuals (mean age 44.4 years, 53.2\%
               women) with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 15 June and 19 December
               2020 using exhaustive electronic health registries. Patients
               were followed for 30 days from inclusion or until the date of
               death within that period. We performed multivariate logistic
               regression to analyze the association between each chronic
               disease and severe infection, based on hospitalization and
               all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 5885 (8.5\%) individuals showed
               severe infection and old age was the most influencing factor.
               Congestive heart failure (odds ratio -OR- men: 1.28, OR women:
               1.39), diabetes (1.37, 1.24), chronic renal failure (1.31, 1.22)
               and obesity (1.21, 1.26) increased the likelihood of severe
               infection in both sexes. Chronic skin ulcers (1.32), acute
               cerebrovascular disease (1.34), chronic obstructive pulmonary
               disease (1.21), urinary incontinence (1.17) and neoplasms (1.26)
               in men, and infertility (1.87), obstructive sleep apnea (1.43),
               hepatic steatosis (1.43), rheumatoid arthritis (1.39) and
               menstrual disorders (1.18) in women were also associated with
               more severe outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Age and specific
               cardiovascular and metabolic diseases increased the risk of
               severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in men and women, whereas the
               effects of certain comorbidities are sex specific. Future
               studies in different settings are encouraged to analyze which
               profiles of chronic patients are at higher risk of poor

               discovery of propranolol. Patients that may require active
               intervention should receive specialist review, ideally before 5
               weeks of age to mitigate the risk of sequelae. Propranolol can
               commence for most infants in the outpatient setting and the most

               Obstetrics \& Gynecology of Tehran University of Medical
               Sciences, and the conventional sampling method was used. We used

               known to play multiple roles in the human body, but an increase
               in its activity may cause a variety of diseases. Elastase
               inhibitors may prevent the development of psoriasis, chronic
               kidney disease, respiratory disorders (including COVID-19),
               immune disorders, and even cancers. Among polyphenolic
               compounds, some flavonoids and their derivatives, which are
               mostly found in herbal plants, have been revealed to influence
               elastase release and its action on human cells. This review

               trajectory, the virus is expected to establish itself as an
               endemic infectious respiratory disease exhibiting seasonal
               flare-ups. Therefore, despite the unprecedented rally to reach a

               important to reach effective prevention and treatment regimens
               for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Contributing to this
               effort, we have curated and analyzed multi-source and
               multi-omics publicly available data from patients, cell lines
               and databases in order to fuel a multiplex computational drug
               repurposing approach. We devised a network-based integration of

               with contemporary regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia
               receive PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) and 10\%-30\% will develop
               allergic reactions. Optimizing access and safety for vaccine
               administration for these patients is critical. This report

               adjustments to ICU organization and care processes globally.
               RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Did hospital emergency responses to the
               COVID-19 pandemic differ depending on hospital setting? Which
               strategies worked well to mitigate strain as perceived by
               intensivists? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Between August and
               November 2020, we carried out semistructured interviews of
               intensivists from tertiary and community hospitals across six
               regions in the United States that experienced early or large
               surges of COVID-19 patients, or both. We identified themes of
               hospital emergency responses using the four S framework of acute
               surge planning: space, staff, stuff, system. RESULTS:
               Thirty-three intensivists from seven tertiary and six community
               hospitals participated. Clinicians across both settings believed
               that canceling elective surgeries was helpful to increase ICU
               capabilities and that hospitals should establish clearly defined
               thresholds at which surgeries are limited during future surge
               events. ICU staff was the most limited resource; staff shortages
               were improved by the use of tiered staffing models, just-in-time
               training for non-ICU clinicians, designated treatment teams, and
               deployment of trainees. Personal protective equipment (PPE)
               shortages and reuse were widespread, causing substantial
               distress among clinicians; hands-on PPE training was helpful to
               reduce clinicians' anxiety. Transparency and involvement of
               frontline clinicians as stakeholders were important components
               of effective emergency responses and helped to maintain trust
               among staff. INTERPRETATION: We identified several strategies
               potentially to mitigate strain as perceived by intensivists
               working in both tertiary and community hospital settings. Our
               study also demonstrated the importance of trust and transparency
               between frontline staff and hospital leadership as key
               components of effective emergency responses during public health

               deferment of many elective cancer surgeries. We performed a
               systematic review on the oncological effects of delayed surgery
               for patients with localised or metastatic renal cell carcinoma
               (RCC) in the targeted therapy (TT) era. METHOD: The protocol of
               this review is registered on PROSPERO(CRD42020190882). A
               comprehensive literature search was performed on Medline, Embase
               and Cochrane CENTRAL using MeSH terms and keywords for
               randomised controlled trials and observational studies on the
               topic. Risks of biases were assessed using the Cochrane RoB tool
               and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. For localised RCC, immediate
               surgery [including partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical
               nephrectomy (RN)] and delayed surgery [including active
               surveillance (AS) and delayed intervention (DI)] were compared.
               For metastatic RCC, upfront versus deferred cytoreductive
               nephrectomy (CN) were compared. RESULTS: Eleven studies were
               included for quantitative analysis. Delayed surgery was
               significantly associated with worse cancer-specific survival (HR
               1.67, 95\% CI 1.23-2.27, p < 0.01) in T1a RCC, but no
               significant difference was noted for overall survival. For
               localised $\geq$ T1b RCC, there were insufficient data for
               meta-analysis and the results from the individual reports were
               contradictory. For metastatic RCC, upfront TT followed by
               deferred CN was associated with better overall survival when
               compared to upfront CN followed by deferred TT (HR 0.61, 95\% CI
               0.43-0.86, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Noting potential selection
               bias, there is insufficient evidence to support the notion that
               delayed surgery is safe in localised RCC. For metastatic RCC,
               upfront TT followed by deferred CN should be considered.",

               observation. Here, we evaluate the real-world long-term efficacy
               of TCZ in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a
               retrospective study of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19
               using a large US-based multicenter COVID-19 database (Cerner
               Real-World Data; updated in September, 2020). The TCZ group was
               defined as patients who received at least one dose of the drug.
               Matching weight (MW) and a propensity score weighting method
               were used to balance confounding factors. RESULTS: A total of
               20,399 patients were identified. 1,510 and 18,899 were in the
               TCZ and control groups, respectively. After MW adjustment, no
               statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality
               were found for the TCZ vs. control group (Hazard Ratio
               [HR]:0.76, p=0.06). Survival curves suggested a better trend in
               short-term observation, driven from a subgroup of patients
               requiring oxygen masks, BIPAP or CPAP. CONCLUSION: We observed a
               temporal (early) benefit of TCZ, especially in patients on
               non-invasive high-flow supplemental oxygen. However, the benefit
               effects faded with longer observation. The long-term benefits

               thrombotic events are characteristic of hospitalized COVID-19
               patients. Given that platelets are key regulators of thrombosis,
               inflammation, and immunity they represent prime candidates as
               mediators of COVID-19-associated pathogenesis. The objective of
               this study was to understand the contribution of severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to the platelet
               phenotype via phenotypic (activation, aggregation) and
               transcriptomic characterization. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In a
               cohort of 3915 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we analyzed blood
               platelet indices collected at hospital admission. Following
               adjustment for demographics, clinical risk factors, medication,
               and biomarkers of inflammation and thrombosis, we find platelet
               count, size, and immaturity are associated with increased
               critical illness and all-cause mortality. Bone marrow, lung
               tissue, and blood from COVID-19 patients revealed the presence
               of SARS-CoV-2 virions in megakaryocytes and platelets.
               Characterization of COVID-19 platelets found them to be
               hyperreactive (increased aggregation, and expression of
               P-selectin and CD40) and to have a distinct transcriptomic
               profile characteristic of prothrombotic large and immature
               platelets. In vitro mechanistic studies highlight that the
               interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with megakaryocytes alters the
               platelet transcriptome, and its effects are distinct from the
               coronavirus responsible for the common cold (CoV-OC43).
               CONCLUSIONS: Platelet count, size, and maturity associate with
               increased critical illness and all-cause mortality among
               hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Profiling tissues and blood from
               COVID-19 patients revealed that SARS-CoV-2 virions enter
               megakaryocytes and platelets and associate with alterations to
               the platelet transcriptome and activation profile.",

               groups of 6 participants to 300, 600 and 800 mg doses of
               molnupiravir orally, twice daily for 5 days or control. A dose
               was judged unsafe if the probability of 30\% or greater

               pathologic outcomes after deferred radical prostatectomy (RP) in
               men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa).
               METHODS: The PubMed database and Web of Science were searched in
               November 2020 according to the PRISMA statement. Studies were
               deemed eligible if they reported the survival and pathologic
               outcomes of patients treated with deferred RP for intermediate-
               and high-risk PCa compared to the control group including those
               patients treated with RP without delay. RESULTS: Overall,
               nineteen studies met our eligibility criteria. We found a
               significant heterogeneity across the studies in terms of
               definitions for delay and outcomes, as well as in patients'
               baseline clinicopathologic features. According to the currently
               available literature, deferred RP does not seem to affect
               oncological survival outcomes, such as prostate cancer-specific
               mortality and metastasis-free survival, in patients with
               intermediate- or high-risk PCa. However, the impact of deferred
               RP on biochemical recurrence rates remains controversial. There
               is no clear association of deferring RP with any of the features
               of aggressive disease such as pathologic upgrading, upstaging,
               positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal
               vesicle invasion, and lymph node invasion. Deferred RP was not
               associated with the need for secondary treatments. CONCLUSIONS:
               Owing to the different definitions of a delayed RP, it is hard
               to make a consensus regarding the safe delay time. However, the
               current data suggest that deferring RP in patients with
               intermediate- and high-risk PCa for at least around 3 months is
               generally safe, as it does not lead to adverse pathologic
               outcomes, biochemical recurrence, the need for secondary
               therapy, or worse oncological survival outcomes.",

               described in registries but were not compared between solid
               tumors and hematological malignancies. METHOD: This
               retrospective single oncologic center study included adults with
               solid tumors or hematological malignancies referred to testing
               by naso-pharyngeal swab for a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from March 10 to
               May 18, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients were included in
               the study. Forty-five (21\%) were tested positive with
               SARS-CoV-2. The univariate analysis with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR
               as a dependent variable reveals significant odds ratios (ORs)
               for age-with a mean of 62.5 years-(OR: 1.05, 95\% CI:
               1.02-1.08), performance status $\geq$2 (OR: 2.38, 95\% CI:
               1.22-4.70), inpatient status (OR: 2.36, 95\%CI: 1.11-4.91), and

               (OR: 0.40, 95\% CI: 0.20-0.81). When integrating severe outcome
               (ICU admission or COVID-19-related death) as a dependent
               variable, the univariate logistic regression model shows
               significant ORs for pre-existing lymphopenia (OR: 4.0, 95\% CI:

               in the United States may be disproportionately impacted by the
               COVID-19 pandemic due to greater experience of peri-pandemic
               stressors. Yet, few studies have systematically examined
               racial/ethnic differences in mental health outcomes in this
               context. METHODS: Data came from the COVID-19 Southern Cities
               Study, a probability-based, cross-sectional study conducted in
               May/June 2020 among adults living in the metropolitan
               statistical areas of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, and New
               Orleans. Unadjusted and adjusted associations between
               racial/ethnic identity and past-week depression and/or anxiety
               symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score $\geq$ 3 or
               Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 score $\geq$ 3), trouble
               sleeping, physical reactions when thinking about COVID-19, and
               self-rated worsened mental health due to the pandemic were
               estimated in separate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Over
               30\% of respondents reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms,
               21\% reported physical reactions, 25\% had trouble sleeping, and
               33\% worsened mental health since the pandemic began. Adjusting
               for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and
               pandemic-related stressors, odds of anxiety symptoms (odds ratio
               (OR) 0.53, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.95) and worsened
               mental health (OR 0.58, 95\% CI 0.36-0.94) were lower among
               non-Hispanic Black vs. non-Hispanic white respondents.
               LIMITATIONS: No diagnostic assessments were used, and results
               may not be generalizable to later phases of the pandemic and the
               entire U.S. South. CONCLUSIONS: Despite greater pandemic-related
               stressor experience, poor mental health outcomes were not more
               common among racial/ethnic minority individuals. However,

               psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care
               providers. However, there is little known about how the COVID-19
               pandemic has impacted radiation therapists (RTs) in Norway or
               Canada. The aim of this investigation was to study the
               psychological impact of working during the COVID-19 pandemic
               among RTs in Canada and Norway. METHODS: Online surveys were
               administered to a convenience sample of RTs and RT department
               managers. Approximately 2000 and 300 RTs were invited to
               participate from Canada and Norway, respectively. The RT survey
               collected information on demographics, work-related stressors,
               psychological impact, quality of life, and workplace support
               programmes. The RT manager survey collected information on
               departmental changes, patient volumes, staff shortages and
               redeployment, personal protective equipment, and infection
               control measures. Descriptive analysis, group comparisons and
               logistic regression were used to examine the impact of COVID-19
               on RTs in the two countries, while open-ended questions were
               examined through thematic analysis. RESULTS: Work-related stress
               and anxiety were prevalent among Canadian (n = 155) and
               Norwegian RTs (n = 124), with Canadian RTs reporting higher
               levels. Fear of transmission, changes in PPE usage, and changes
               in staffing were reported as the most frequent work-related
               stressors. Themes related to working during the pandemic
               included: generalised anxiety; physical, emotional and cognitive
               symptoms of stress; and loneliness, as well as negative impact
               on health and quality of relationships. Survey findings from RT
               department managers in Canada (n = 12) and Norway (n = 13)
               suggest that the pandemic had an organisational impact on RT
               departments due to implemented infection control measures and
               changes in staffing. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led
               to similar stressors amongst Canadian and Norwegian RTs but
               relatively higher levels of psychological impact among Canadian
               RTs. Findings demonstrate the importance of mental health
               support programmes in the workplace to mitigate the
               psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on RTs.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic presented healthcare
               providers with an extreme challenge to provide cancer services.
               The impact upon the diagnostic and treatment capacity to treat
               pancreatic cancer is unclear. This study aimed to identify
               national variation in treatment pathways during the pandemic.
               METHODS: A survey was distributed to all United Kingdom
               pancreatic specialist centres, to assess diagnostic, therapeutic
               and interventional services availability, and alterations in
               treatment pathways. A repeating methodology enabled assessment
               over time as the pandemic evolved. RESULTS: Responses were
               received from all 29 centres. Over the first six weeks of the
               pandemic, less than a quarter of centres had normal availability
               of diagnostic pathways and a fifth of centres had no capacity
               whatsoever to undertake surgery. As the pandemic progressed
               services have gradually improved though most centres remain
               constrained to some degree. One third of centres changed their
               standard resectable pathway from surgery-first to neoadjuvant
               chemotherapy. Elderly patients, and those with COPD were less
               likely to be offered treatment during the pandemic. CONCLUSION:
               The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the capacity of the NHS to
               provide diagnostic and staging investigations for pancreatic
               cancer. The impact of revised treatment pathways has yet to be
               realised.",

               public health problem that has already caused more than 662 000
               deaths worldwide. Although the clinical manifestations of
               COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients
               present other severe damage such as cardiovascular, renal and
               liver injury, and/or multiple organ failure, suggesting a spread
               of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2) in blood. Recent ultrasensitive polymerase chain
               reaction (PCR) technology now allows absolute quantification of
               nucleic acids in plasma. We intend to use the droplet-based
               digital PCR technology to obtain sensitive detection and precise
               quantification of plasma SARS-CoV-2 viral load (SARS-CoV-2
               RNAemia) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight
               consecutive COVID-19 patients with pneumonia 8 to 12 days after
               onset of symptoms and 12 healthy controls were analyzed. Disease
               severity was categorized as mild to moderate in 17 patients,
               severe in 16, and critical in 26. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was
               quantified by droplet digital Crystal Digital PCR
               next-generation technology (Stilla Technologies, Villejuif,
               France). RESULTS: Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was detected in 43
               (74.1\%) patients. Prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia
               correlated with disease severity, ranging from 53\% in
               mild-to-moderate patients to 88\% in critically ill patients (P
               = .036). Levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia were associated with
               severity (P = .035). Among 9 patients who experienced clinical
               deterioration during follow-up, 8 had positive SARS-CoV-2
               RNAemia at baseline, whereas only 1 critical patient with
               undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia at the time of analysis died at
               day 27. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia measured by droplet-based

               disproportionately results in hospitalization or death in older
               patients and those with underlying conditions. Sotrovimab is a
               pan-sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody that was designed to
               prevent progression of Covid-19 in high-risk patients early in
               the course of disease. METHODS: In this ongoing, multicenter,
               double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1
               ratio, nonhospitalized patients with symptomatic Covid-19
               ($\leq$5 days after the onset of symptoms) and at least one risk
               factor for disease progression to receive a single infusion of
               sotrovimab at a dose of 500 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy
               outcome was hospitalization (for >24 hours) for any cause or
               death within 29 days after randomization. RESULTS: In this
               prespecified interim analysis, which included an
               intention-to-treat population of 583 patients (291 in the
               sotrovimab group and 292 in the placebo group), 3 patients (1\%)
               in the sotrovimab group, as compared with 21 patients (7\%) in
               the placebo group, had disease progression leading to
               hospitalization or death (relative risk reduction, 85\%; 97.24\%
               confidence interval, 44 to 96; P = 0.002). In the placebo group,
               5 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, including 1
               who died by day 29. Safety was assessed in 868 patients (430 in
               the sotrovimab group and 438 in the placebo group). Adverse
               events were reported by 17\% of the patients in the sotrovimab
               group and 19\% of those in the placebo group; serious adverse
               events were less common with sotrovimab than with placebo (in
               2\% and 6\% of the patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among
               high-risk patients with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, sotrovimab

               many diseases and provide an exciting avenue toward antiviral
               therapeutics. From patient transcriptomic data, we determined
               that a circulating miRNA, miR-2392, is directly involved with
               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

               mitochondrial gene expression, increasing inflammation,
               glycolysis, and hypoxia, as well as promoting many symptoms
               associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

               negative for COVID-19. These findings indicate the potential for
               developing a minimally invasive COVID-19 detection method.
               Lastly, using in vitro human and in vivo hamster models, we
               design a miRNA-based antiviral therapeutic that targets
               miR-2392, significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 viability in

               those of at least moderate severity and lasting at least 2 days.
               We found that symptoms were more frequent following the second
               vaccine dose than the first (74\% vs. 60\%, P 80\% of all
               symptoms resolving within 2 days. The most common symptom was

               hematology-oncology patients is essential to the optimal
               management of these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
               study describes the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19
               disease in children with cancer or hematologic disorders treated
               at a large children's hospital. A retrospective cohort study was
               conducted at Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center from
               January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. All patients with a
               primary hematology-oncology diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 positivity
               by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were
               identified. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the
               medical record. Descriptive analyses were performed to evaluate
               COVID-19-related outcomes and risk factors for severe disease in
               this population. We identified 109 patients with COVID-19
               disease, including 52 hematology, 51 oncology, and 6 HSCT
               patients; median age was 10.3 years (IQR 4.4-15.9), and 58.7\%
               were male. Seventy-four percent of the patients were managed in
               the outpatient setting. Patients with sickle cell disease were
               more likely to require hospitalization. ICU care was needed in
               8\% (n = 9) of the entire cohort, and mechanical ventilation was
               required in 6.4\% (6 oncology patients, 1 hematology patient).
               COVID-19 contributed to the deaths of two cancer patients. No
               deaths occurred in hematology or HSCT patients. In conclusion,
               the risk of severe COVID-19 complications is slightly higher in
               pediatric hematology-oncology patients than in the general
               pediatric population but lower than initially feared. For most
               asymptomatic patients, primary disease management may continue
               as planned, but treatment decisions must be individualized.",

               axillary surgery in breast cancer patients with low-volume
               axillary disease treated with a surgery-first approach. However,
               few data exist to guide axillary surgery following neoadjuvant
               endocrine therapy (NET). Therefore, we evaluated the extent and
               outcomes of axillary surgery in a contemporary cohort of NET
               patients, a treatment approach that has become particularly
               relevant during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic.
               PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified invasive breast cancer
               patients treated with NET between October 2008 and November
               2019. Patients presenting with stage IV disease or recurrent
               disease were excluded. Statistical analyses were performed using
               chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
               RESULTS: 194 invasive breast cancers in 186 patients (median age
               66 years) were evaluated; 81 patients had breast-conserving
               surgery (BCS), while 113 underwent mastectomy. Eighty-four
               patients (43.3\%) were biopsy-proven cN+ with 4/84 (4.8\%) ypN0
               following NET. Among cN+ patients, 14 (16.7\%) had sentinel
               lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only, 27 (32.1\%) had SLNB + axillary
               lymph node dissection (ALND), and 43 (51.2\%) had ALND. Among
               110 cN0 patients, 99 had axillary surgery with 28/99 (28.3\%)
               ypN+: SLNB in 83 (75.5\%), SLNB+ALND in 14 (12.7\%), and ALND in
               2 (1.8\%). Among all ypN+ patients, 23/108 (21.3\%) had SLNB
               alone: 18/43 (41.9\%) of BCS and 5/65 (7.7\%) mastectomy
               patients (p < 0.001). After median follow-up of 35 months, no
               regional recurrences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Among
               biopsy-proven cN+ NET patients, we observed deescalation of
               axillary surgery in selected patients, despite a low nodal
               pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, without nodal
               recurrences. These data suggest that patients with low-volume
               axillary disease treated with NET may be managed similarly to
               patients treated with a surgery-first approach.",

               Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer
               occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanic individuals
               in the United States using the most recent population-based
               data. An estimated 176,600 new cancer cases and 46,500 cancer
               deaths will occur among Hispanic individuals in the continental
               United States and Hawaii in 2021. Compared to non-Hispanic
               Whites (NHWs), Hispanic men and women had 25\%-30\% lower
               incidence (2014-2018) and mortality (2015-2019) rates for all
               cancers combined and lower rates for the most common cancers,
               although this gap is diminishing. For example, the colorectal
               cancer (CRC) incidence rate ratio for Hispanic compared with NHW
               individuals narrowed from 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.73-0.78) in 1995 to
               0.91 (95\% CI, 0.89-0.93) in 2018, reflecting delayed declines
               in CRC rates among Hispanic individuals in part because of
               slower uptake of screening. In contrast, Hispanic individuals
               have higher rates of infection-related cancers, including
               approximately two-fold higher incidence of liver and stomach
               cancer. Cervical cancer incidence is 32\% higher among Hispanic
               women in the continental US and Hawaii and 78\% higher among
               women in Puerto Rico compared to NHW women, yet is largely
               preventable through screening. Less access to care may be
               similarly reflected in the low prevalence of localized-stage
               breast cancer among Hispanic women, 59\% versus 67\% among NHW
               women. Evidence-based strategies for decreasing the cancer
               burden among the Hispanic population include the use of
               culturally appropriate lay health advisors and patient
               navigators and targeted, community-based intervention programs
               to facilitate access to screening and promote healthy behaviors.
               In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer
               trends and disparities in the Hispanic population should be
               closely monitored.",

               597 patients underwent surgery with a median age of 65 years
               (interquartile range (IQR) 54-74 years). Of these, 86.1\%

               clinical RT-PCR assays using different sampling strategies. A
               total of 1,378 participants were tested across 4 study sites.
               Compared with standard of care RT-PCR testing, the overall
               sensitivity and specificity of the Atila iAMP test for detection
               of SARS-CoV-2 were 76.2\% and 94.9\%, respectively, and
               increased to 88.8\% and 89.5\%, respectively, after exclusion of
               an outlier study site. Sensitivity varied based on the anatomic
               site from which the sample was collected. Sensitivity for
               nasopharyngeal sampling was 65.4\% (range across study sites,

               55.1\% (range across study sites, 42.9\% to 77.8\%), and for
               anterior nares was 66.7\% (range across study sites, 63.6\% to
               76.5\%). The specificity for these anatomic collection sites
               ranged from 96.7\% to 100\%. Sensitivity improved in symptomatic
               patients (overall, 82.7\%) and those with a higher viral load
               (overall, 92.4\% for cycle threshold [CT] of $\leq$25).
               Sensitivity and specificity of the OptiGene direct plus RT-LAMP
               test, which was conducted at a single study site, were 25.5\%
               and 100\%, respectively. The Atila iAMP COVID test with
               midturbinate sampling is a rapid, low-cost assay for detecting
               SARS-CoV-2, especially in symptomatic patients and those with a
               high viral load, and could be used to reduce the risk of
               SARS-CoV-2 transmission in clinical settings. Variation of
               performance between study sites highlights the need for
               site-specific clinical validation of these assays before
               clinical adoption. IMPORTANCE Numerous SARS-CoV-2 detection
               assays have been developed and introduced into the market under
               emergency use authorizations (EUAs). EUAs are granted primarily
               based on small studies of analytic sensitivity and specificity
               with limited clinical validations. A thorough clinical
               performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 assays is important to
               understand the strengths, limitations, and specific applications
               of these assays. In this first large-scale multicentric study,
               we evaluated the clinical performance and operational
               characteristics of two isothermal amplification-based SARS-CoV-2
               tests, namely, (i) iAMP COVID-19 detection test (Atila
               BioSystems, USA) and (ii) COVID-19 direct plus RT-LAMP test
               (OptiGene Ltd., UK), compared with those of clinical RT-PCR
               tests using different sampling strategies (i.e., nasopharyngeal,
               self-sampled anterior nares, self-sampled midturbinate, and

               patients who had been admitted to critical care due to severe
               COVID-19 were invited to an established recovery service.
               Standardised questionnaires concerning emotional, physical and
               social recovery, including information on employment, were
               completed by patients. Using propensity score matching, we

               potentially making such a biomarker an earlier triage tool.
               Here, we evaluate whether hFwe-Lose gene expression can
               outperform conventional methods in predicting outcomes (e.g.,
               death and hospitalization) in COVID-19 patients. We performed a

               COVID-19 patients to determine hFwe-Lose's biological role in
               acute lung injury. We then performed an observational study (n =
               283) to evaluate whether hFwe-Lose expression (in nasopharyngeal
               samples) could accurately predict hospitalization or death in
               COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 patients with acute lung injury,
               hFwe-Lose is highly expressed in the lower respiratory tract and
               is co-localized to areas of cell death. In patients presenting
               in the early phase of COVID-19 illness, hFwe-Lose expression
               accurately predicts subsequent hospitalization or death with
               positive predictive values of 87.8-100\% and a negative
               predictive value of 64.1-93.2\%. hFwe-Lose outperforms

               METHODS: We compared referrals to oncologic surgical specialty
               clinics at an academic tertiary care institution following
               implementation of stay-at-home orders in California
               (3/19/20-7/31/20, ``COVID'') to the same time period the year
               prior (3/19/19-7/31/19, ``Pre-COVID''). The number of
               appointments, consulted surgical services, insurance types,
               acuity of diagnoses, and times from referral to first
               appointment (TRFA) were assessed. RESULTS: The overall number of
               patients seen in matched time periods decreased by 21.6\% from
               900 (pre-COVID) to 705 (COVID). Proportions of patients with
               malignant and suspicious diagnoses, surgical and thoracic
               oncology visits, and Medicaid insurance differed from comparison
               groups during the COVID period (P < .05). Overall median

               receptor for the spike protein, the aptamer to bind to the spike
               S1 protein has been first screened by a SELEX technique and then
               immobilized on the previously prepared nanochannels. In the
               presence of SARS-CoV-2, the changes in steric hindrance and
               charge density on the surface of the nanochannels will affect
               the ion transport, along with a rapid electrochemical response.

               in-person to telehealth visits with providers using digital
               video and audio tools to reach patients at home. Advantages to
               telehealth care include enhanced patient convenience and
               provider efficiencies, but financial, geographic, privacy, and
               access barriers to telehealth also exist. These are

               threatening to worsen preexisting disparities in tobacco use and
               health. Pandemic-associated regulatory changes regarding privacy

               January 2020 and 15 June 2020 at a tertiary academic center was
               assessed using change-point-detection (CPD) analysis. COVID-19
               epidemiologic trend was obtained from Connecticut Department of
               Public Health records. Demographic and oncologic data were
               gathered from electronic medical records and PET-CT scans by
               four reviewers in consensus. RESULTS: A total of 1685 cases were
               reviewed. CPD analysis identified five distinct phases of PET-CT
               utilization during COVID-19, with a sharp decline and a gradual
               recovery. There was a 62.5\% decline in case volumes at the
               nadir. These changes correlated with COVID-19 epidemiologic
               changes in the state of Connecticut, with a negative correlation
               between COVID-19 cases and PET-CT utilization ($\tau$ = -0.54; P
               value < 0.001). Statistically significant differences in age,
               race, cancer type and current and prior scan positivity were
               observed in these five phases. A greater percentage of young
               patients and minorities were scanned during the pandemic
               relative to baseline. PET/CT scanning was less impacted for
               hematologic malignancies than for solid cancers, with less
               profound decline and better recovery. DISCUSSION: PET-CT cancer
               imaging was vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic at our
               institution. Epidemiologic, demographic and oncologic factors

               used in acute care settings. In this review, we consider recent
               advances in the utilization of NHF in chronic obstructive
               pulmonary disease (COPD), terminal cancer and symptom
               management. Considerations around NHF use during the severe
               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic
               are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: NHF enables humidification
               and high flows to be provided together with titrated,
               supplemental oxygen therapy. Compared to conventional oxygen
               therapy, NHF improves respiratory physiology by reducing
               workload, enhancing muco-ciliary clearance and improving dead
               space washout. Some studies suggest that early use of NHF in
               people being cared for in the emergency department leads to
               lower rates of invasive ventilation and noninvasive ventilation.
               There is also emerging evidence for NHF use in people with COPD
               and chronic respiratory failure, and in palliative care. NHF is
               comfortable, well-tolerated and safe for use in the management
               of breathlessness in people with cancer. NHF can be delivered by
               face mask to patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to ease the
               burden on critical care resources. SUMMARY: The evidence base

               accompanied by a demographic and occupational survey
               administered to healthcare workers. SETTING: A large, urban
               public healthcare system in NYC. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were
               employed by NYC H+H and either completed serological testing at
               NYC H+H between 30 April 2020 and 30 June 2020, or completed

               MEASURE: SARS-CoV-2 serostatus, stratified by key demographic
               and occupational characteristics reported through the
               demographic and occupational survey. RESULTS: Seven hundred and

               tested positive or reported testing positive for the presence of
               SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG+). Characteristics associated with
               positive SARS-CoV-2 serostatus were Black race (25\% IgG +vs
               15\% IgG-, p=0.001), having someone in the household with

               treatment. Laboratory examinations were repeatedly measured

               possibility for the individualized early prediction of

               ignoring disease progression and changes of biomarkers over
               time. By using historical regression trees (HTREEs), a novel
               machine learning method, and joint modeling technique, we
               modeled the longitudinal trajectories of laboratory biomarkers
               and made dynamically predictions on individual prognosis for
               1997 COVID-19 patients. In the discovery phase, based on 358

               second validation dataset including 1527 patients,
               respectively). In conclusion, our study identified important
               biomarkers associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients,

               special populations are complex and challenging. Few studies
               have addressed the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric patients with
               cancer in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: Multicenter
               observational cohort study with prospective records and
               retrospective analyses starting in April 2020 in 21 pediatric
               oncology centers distributed throughout Brazil. PARTICIPANTS:
               Patients under 18 years of age who are infected by the
               SARS-CoV-2 virus (confirmed diagnosis through reverse
               transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) while under
               treatment at pediatric oncology centers. The variables of
               interest included clinical symptoms, diagnostic and therapeutic
               measures. The repercussions of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cancer
               treatment and general prognosis were monitored. RESULTS: One
               hundred seventy-nine patients were included (median age 6 [4-13]
               years, 58\% male). Of these, 55.9\% had acute leukemia and
               34.1\% had solid tumors. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was
               diagnosed by RT-PCR. Various laboratory markers were analyzed,
               but showed no correlation with outcome. Children with low or
               high BMI for age had lower overall survival (71.4\% and 82.6\%,
               respectively) than those with age-appropriate BMI (92.7\%) (p =
               .007). The severity of presentation at diagnosis was
               significantly associated with outcome (p < .001). Overall
               mortality in the presence of infection was 12.3\% (n = 22).
               CONCLUSION: In children with cancer and COVID-19, lower BMI was
               associated with worse prognosis. The mortality in this group of
               patients (12.3\%) was significantly higher than that described
               in the pediatric population overall (∼1\%).",

  abstract  = "Importance: The evidence for benefit of convalescent plasma for
               critically ill patients with COVID-19 is inconclusive.
               Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma would
               improve outcomes for critically ill adults with COVID-19.
               Design, Setting, and Participants: The ongoing Randomized,
               Embedded, Multifactorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for
               Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) enrolled and randomized
               4763 adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 between March
               9, 2020, and January 18, 2021, within at least 1 domain; 2011
               critically ill adults were randomized to open-label
               interventions in the immunoglobulin domain at 129 sites in 4
               countries. Follow-up ended on April 19, 2021. Interventions: The
               immunoglobulin domain randomized participants to receive 2 units
               of high-titer, ABO-compatible convalescent plasma (total volume
               of 550 mL $\pm$ 150 mL) within 48 hours of randomization (n =
               1084) or no convalescent plasma (n = 916). Main Outcomes and
               Measures: The primary ordinal end point was organ support-free
               days (days alive and free of intensive care unit-based organ
               support) up to day 21 (range, -1 to 21 days; patients who died
               were assigned -1 day). The primary analysis was an adjusted
               bayesian cumulative logistic model. Superiority was defined as
               the posterior probability of an odds ratio (OR) greater than 1
               (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99\%). Futility
               was defined as the posterior probability of an OR less than 1.2
               (threshold for trial conclusion of futility >95\%). An OR
               greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ
               support-free days, or both. The prespecified secondary outcomes
               included in-hospital survival; 28-day survival; 90-day survival;
               respiratory support-free days; cardiovascular support-free days;
               progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal
               mechanical oxygenation, or death; intensive care unit length of
               stay; hospital length of stay; World Health Organization ordinal
               scale score at day 14; venous thromboembolic events at 90 days;
               and serious adverse events. Results: Among the 2011 participants
               who were randomized (median age, 61 [IQR, 52 to 70] years and
               645/1998 [32.3\%] women), 1990 (99\%) completed the trial. The
               convalescent plasma intervention was stopped after the
               prespecified criterion for futility was met. The median number
               of organ support-free days was 0 (IQR, -1 to 16) in the
               convalescent plasma group and 3 (IQR, -1 to 16) in the no
               convalescent plasma group. The in-hospital mortality rate was
               37.3\% (401/1075) for the convalescent plasma group and 38.4\%
               (347/904) for the no convalescent plasma group and the median
               number of days alive and free of organ support was 14 (IQR, 3 to
               18) and 14 (IQR, 7 to 18), respectively. The median-adjusted OR
               was 0.97 (95\% credible interval, 0.83 to 1.15) and the
               posterior probability of futility (OR <1.2) was 99.4\% for the
               convalescent plasma group compared with the no convalescent
               plasma group. The treatment effects were consistent across the
               primary outcome and the 11 secondary outcomes. Serious adverse
               events were reported in 3.0\% (32/1075) of participants in the
               convalescent plasma group and in 1.3\% (12/905) of participants
               in the no convalescent plasma group. Conclusions and Relevance:
               Among critically ill adults with confirmed COVID-19, treatment
               with 2 units of high-titer, ABO-compatible convalescent plasma
               had a low likelihood of providing improvement in the number of
               organ support-free days. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov

               released a joint statement recommending that all breast
               screening studies be postponed effective March 26, 2020. STUDY
               DESIGN: A retrospective review of all canceled mammograms at a
               single tertiary care institution from January 1-August 31, 2020
               was performed to evaluate the effect of this recommendation by
               quantifying both the number and reason for mammogram
               cancellations before and after March 26, 2020. Utilization of
               the electronic patient portal for appointment cancellation as a
               surrogate for telehealth uptake was noted. RESULTS: During the
               study period, 5340 mammogram appointments were kept and 2784
               mammogram appointments were canceled. From a baseline of 30
               (10.8\%) canceled mammograms in January, cancellations peaked in
               March (576, 20.6\%) and gradually decreased to a low in August
               (197, 7\%). Reasons for cancellations varied significantly by
               month (P < .0001) and included COVID-19 related (236, 8.5\%),
               unspecified patient reasons (1,210, 43.5\%), administrative
               issues (147, 5.3\%), provider requests (46, 1.7\%), sooner
               appointments available (31, 1.1\%), and reasons not given (486,
               17.5\%). In addition, compared to a baseline in January (51,
               16.5\%), electronic patient portal access peaked in August (67,
               34.0\%). CONCLUSION: Screening mammogram cancellations have
               gradually recovered after early COVID-19 restrictions were
               lifted and increasing use of electronic patient access appears
               to be sustained. Consequences for future staging at the time of
               diagnosis remain unknown. Understanding to what extent the

               (MIS-C). METHODS: This single-center retrospective review
               included 30 patients diagnosed with MIS-C from March 1 to
               September 1, 2020. Thromboelastography (TEG) with platelet
               mapping was performed in 19 (63\%) patients and compared to age-
               and sex-matched controls prior to cardiac surgery. Relationships
               between TEG parameters and inflammatory markers were assessed
               using correlation. RESULTS: Patients with MIS-C had abnormal TEG
               results compared to controls, including decreased kinetic (K)
               time (1.1 vs. 1.7 minutes, p < .01), increased alpha angle
               (75.0° vs. 65.7°, p < .01), increased maximum amplitude (70.8
               vs. 58.3 mm, p < .01), and decreased lysis in 30 minutes (Ly30)
               (1.1\% vs. 3.7\%, p = .03); consistent with increased clot
               formation rate and strength, and reduced fibrinolysis. TEG
               maximum amplitude was moderately correlated with erythrocyte
               sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = 0.60, p = .02), initial platelet
               count (r = 0.67, p < .01), and peak platelet count (r = 0.51, p
               = .03). TEG alpha angle was moderately correlated with peak
               platelet count (r = 0.54, p = .02). Seventeen (57\%) patients
               received aspirin (ASA) and anticoagulation, five (17\%) received
               only ASA, and three (10\%) received only anticoagulation. No
               patients had a symptomatic thrombotic event. Six (20\%) patients
               had a bleeding event, none of which was major. CONCLUSIONS:
               Patients with MIS-C had evidence of hypercoagulability on TEG.
               Increased ESR and platelets were associated with higher clot
               strength. Patients were prophylactically treated with ASA or
               anticoagulation with no symptomatic thrombosis or major
               bleeding. Further multicenter study is required to characterize

               with inborn errors of immunity (IEIs); however, little is known
               about immunogenicity and safety in these patients. OBJECTIVE: We
               sought to evaluate the impact of genetic diagnosis, age, and
               treatment on antibody response to COVID-19 vaccine and related
               adverse events in a cohort of patients with IEIs. METHODS:
               Plasma was collected from 22 health care worker controls, 81
               patients with IEIs, and 2 patients with thymoma; the plasma was
               collected before immunization, 1 to 6 days before the second
               dose of mRNA vaccine, and at a median of 30 days after
               completion of the immunization schedule with either mRNA vaccine
               or a single dose of Johnson \& Johnson's Janssen vaccine.
               Anti-spike (anti-S) and anti-nucleocapsid antibody titers were
               measured by using a luciferase immunoprecipitation systems
               method. Information on T- and B-cell counts and use of
               immunosuppressive drugs was extracted from medical records, and
               information on vaccine-associated adverse events was collected
               after each dose. RESULTS: Anti-S antibodies were detected in 27
               of 46 patients (58.7\%) after 1 dose of mRNA vaccine and in 63
               of 74 fully immunized patients (85.1\%). A lower rate of
               seroconversion (7 of 11 [63.6\%]) was observed in patients with
               autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy.
               Previous use of rituximab and baseline counts of less than 1000
               CD3+ T cells/mL and less than 100 CD19+ B cells/mL were
               associated with lower anti-S IgG levels. No significant adverse
               events were reported. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating patients with IEIs
               is safe, but immunogenicity is affected by certain therapies and
               gene defects. These data may guide the counseling of patients
               with IEIs regarding prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the
               need for subsequent boosts.",

               neck surgery patients. METHODS: The study population included
               patients who underwent head and neck surgery at an academic
               tertiary care center between February 2020 and November 2020 and
               were discharged with one to four drains with instructions for
               home removal. Prior to discharge, patients received thorough
               drain removal education. Patients were prospectively followed to
               evaluate for associated outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred patients
               were evaluated in the study. There was record for ninety-seven
               patients receiving education at discharge. The most common
               methods of education were face-to-face education and written
               instructions with educational video link provided. Of 123 drains
               upon discharge, 110 drains (89.4\%) were removed at home while
               13 (10.6\%) were removed in office. Most drains were located in
               the neck (86.4\%). There was one seroma, two hematomas, two
               drain site infections, and five ED visits; however, none of
               these complications were directly associated with the action of
               drain removal at home. Calculated cost savings for travel and
               lost wages was \$259.82 per round trip saved. CONCLUSIONS: The
               results demonstrate that home drain removal can provide a safe
               and efficacious option for patients following head and neck
               surgery. This approach was safe and associated with patient cost
               savings and better utilization of provider's time. Furthermore,
               patients and healthcare providers avoided additional in-person
               encounters and exposures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
               findings warrant further investigation into cost savings and
               formal patient satisfaction associated with home drain removal.

               remain unclear. This study aimed to understand the influences of
               COVID-19 on different comorbidities and vice versa through
               network-based gene expression analyses. Using the shared
               dysregulated genes, we identified key genetic determinants and
               signaling pathways that may involve in their shared
               pathogenesis. The COVID-19 showed significant upregulation of 93
               genes and downregulation of 15 genes. Interestingly, it shares
               28, 17, 6 and 7 genes with diabetes mellitus (DM), lung cancer
               (LC), myocardial infarction and hypertension, respectively.
               Importantly, COVID-19 shared three upregulated genes (i.e. MX2,
               IRF7 and ADAM8) with DM and LC. Conversely, downregulation of
               two genes (i.e. PPARGC1A and METTL7A) was found in COVID-19 and

               inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we identified six potential
               biomarkers and several important regulatory factors, e.g.
               transcription factors and microRNAs, while notable drug
               candidates included captopril, rilonacept and canakinumab.
               Moreover, prognostic analysis suggests concomitant COVID-19 may
               result in poor outcome of LC patients. This study provides the
               molecular basis and routes of the COVID-19 progression due to
               comorbidities. We believe these findings might be useful to
               further understand the intricate association of these diseases

               for specialty palliative care. The Palliative Care Quality
               Collaborative (PCQC) provides unique infrastructure for rapid
               data collection and analysis. Objectives: To capture and
               describe real-time, real-world experiences of specialty
               palliative care professionals caring for patients with COVID-19
               through a rapid reporting tool and registry. Setting: Palliative
               care clinicians consulted for patients either positive for
               COVID-19, under investigation for COVID-19, or recovered from
               COVID-19. Design: The PCQC created a 13-item COVID-19 case
               report form (CRF), modeled after the PCQC core dataset for
               specialty palliative care quality measurement. Twelve items
               offered discrete answer choices and one was open-ended. The CRF
               was publicized widely (e.g., social media, e-mail list serves)
               and completed through a link on the PCQC website. Results: Three
               hundred six reports (298 adult, 8 pediatric) were submitted
               between April 6, 2020 and October 7, 2020. The majority of
               patients (83\%) were 50 years or older; 25\% were 80 or older,
               and 78\% were COVID-19 positive. Male gender identity was
               significantly more prevalent than female (58\% vs. 40\%, p <
               0.002). The most common comorbidity was cardiovascular disease
               (23\%). Of adult hospital-based patients, 69\% were full code
               before palliative care consultation versus 28\% after (p <
               0.05). All pediatric patients were full code before and after
               palliative care consult. Qualitative themes were strained
               communication with patients, family visitation challenges,
               communication barriers between clinicians and families, rapid
               changes in palliative care medical management, community care
               options difficult to find, lack of testing in community-based
               settings, and guardianship and legal challenges. Conclusion:
               Preliminary data from the first 306 patients reported to the
               PCQC COVID-19 Registry describe palliative care use concentrated

               products for hematopoietic transplantation prior to the

               the effect of this change on unrelated donor product quality and

               Transplant Recipient Registry (ABMTRR). In total, 191 products
               were collected between April 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021,
               and most (74\%) were from international collection centers.
               Median post-thaw CD34 recovery was 78\% (range 25\% to 176\%)
               and median post-thaw CD34 viability was 87\% (range 34\% to
               112\%). Median time to neutrophil recovery was 17 days
               (interquartile range 10 to 24 days), and graft failure occurred
               in 6 patients (4\%). These clinical outcomes were similar to
               those of ``fresh'' unrelated donor transplants reported to the
               ABMTRR in 2019. However, recipient transplantation centers
               reported problems with 29\% of products in the form of damage

               mental illness, including bipolar disorder (BD), remains
               unclear, warranting scoping review on the matter. METHODS: The
               MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically searched from
               inception up to April 24, 2021, adopting broad inclusion
               criteria to assess a variety of clinical and public health
               themes related to people with a primary diagnosis of BD during
               the COVID-19 pandemics. The present work complying with the
               Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
               Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR)
               registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository
               (https://osf.io/7evpx/). RESULTS: Fourteen papers informed the
               present scoping review. Four major themes were identified: (i)
               impact of COVID-19-related stressors on BD; (ii) impact of
               COVID-19 on mental health service utilization among people with
               BD; (iii) impact of BD on the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2

               people with BD. Additional themes warranting further research

               essential to generate neutralizing antibodies, T cells on their
               own have been recognized as another major player in effective

               HLA-A*24:02-restricted SARS-CoV-2-reactive TCRs, isolated from

               SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cell populations were clearly detectable
               in convalescent samples and that TCRs isolated from these T cell
               clones were highly functional upon ectopic re-expression. The

               potent TCR signaling in reporter assays with low nanomolar EC50

               analysis (BCA) with CT imaging. RECENT FINDINGS: CT images can
               be used to evaluate muscle tissue, visceral adipose tissue
               (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) compartments.
               Manual and semiautomatic segmentation methods are still the gold
               standards. The segmentation of skeletal muscle tissue and VAT
               and SAT compartments is most often performed at the level of the
               3rd lumbar vertebra. A decreased amount of CT-determined
               skeletal muscle mass is a marker of impaired survival in many
               patient populations, including patients with most types of
               cancer, some surgical patients, and those admitted to the
               intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with increased VAT are more
               susceptible to impaired survival / worse outcomes; however,
               those patients who are critically ill or admitted to the ICU or
               who will undergo surgery appear to be exceptions. The
               independent significance of SAT is less well established.
               Recently, the roles of the CT-determined decrease of muscle mass
               and increased VAT area and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT)

               exposure, coupled with engaged decision making to prioritize
               cancer treatment in parallel with reducing risk of exposure and
               infection, is crucial in the management of COVID-19 during
               cancer treatment. After two reported case studies of imaging
               findings during daily computed tomography (CT)-based
               image-guided radiotherapy (RT) scans, a call for submission of
               anonymized case reports was published with the objective of
               rapidly determining if there was a correlation between the onset
               of new pulmonary infiltrates found during RT and COVID-19. We
               hereby report the results of the aggregate analysis. METHODS:
               Data of deidentified case reports for patients who developed
               biochemically confirmed COVID-19 during RT were submitted
               through an online portal. Information requested included a
               patient's sex, age, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19
               diagnosis and outcome. Coplanar CT-based imaging was requested
               to reveal the presence or absence of ground-glass opacities or
               infiltrates. RESULTS: A total of seven reports were submitted
               from Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Egypt, and the United States.
               Results and imaging from the patients reported by Suppli et al.
               and McGinnis et al. were included for a total of nine patients
               for analysis. All patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive
               using polymerase chain reaction-based methods or nasopharyngeal
               swabs. Of the nine patients analyzed, abnormalities consistent
               with ground-glass opacities or infiltrates were observed in
               eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest case series
               revealing the potential use of CT-based image guidance during RT
               as a tool for identifying patients who need further workup for
               COVID-19. Considerations for reviewing image guidance for new
               pulmonary infiltrates and immediate COVID-19 testing in patients
               who develop new infiltrates even without COVID-19 symptoms are
               strongly encouraged.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Restriction in healthcare services during the
               COVID-19 pandemic caused delays in the diagnosis and treatment
               of several diseases. To overcome the risk of missed diagnosis of
               head and neck cancers, before deleting the scheduled
               appointments, we have introduced a selection of the patients by
               examining the clinical presenting issue and previous medical
               history. The aim of this study is to show the effects of the
               abovementioned strategy on the diagnosis and management of
               laryngeal cancer. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Hospital
               software regarding the new diagnosis of laryngeal SCC in the
               periods from March 2020 to December 2020 during the pandemic
               (study group) and from March 2019 to December 2019 (control
               group) were collected. Data were compared regarding: TNM stage,
               time from first medical examination to histological diagnosis
               (Time-1), and time form histological diagnosis to beginning of
               treatments (Time-2). RESULTS: The final study group was composed
               by 19 laryngeal cancers, the control group by 25 cases. No
               significant differences were found in the tumour stage between
               the groups. In the study group, Time-1 was shorter (24 days
               versus 43 days, p = 0.012), while Time-2 in surgically-treated
               patients was longer (20 days versus 9 days, p = 0.012).
               CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, there was a dramatic lack of
               medical and nurse staff needed for surgical procedures. As
               consequence, the time between the diagnosis of malignancy and
               surgical treatment increased. In our unit, an efficient patient
               selection strategy to reschedule medical appointments avoided a
               dangerous shift toward higher laryngeal cancer stages.",

               for the RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current
               COVID-19 pandemic, are being developed and refined worldwide for
               early detection of disease outbreaks. We report here on lessons
               learned from establishing a WBS program for SARS-CoV-2
               integrated with a human surveillance program for COVID-19. We
               have established WBS at three campuses of a university,
               including student residential dormitories and a hospital that
               treats COVID-19 patients. Lessons learned from this WBS program
               address the variability of water quality, new detection
               technologies, the range of detectable viral loads in wastewater,
               and the predictive value of integrating environmental and human
               surveillance data. Data from our WBS program indicated that
               water quality was statistically different between sewer sampling
               sites, with more variability observed in wastewater coming from
               individual buildings compared to clusters of buildings. A new
               detection technology was developed based upon the use of a novel
               polymerase called V2G. Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in
               wastewater varied from 102 to 106 genomic copies (gc) per liter
               of raw wastewater (L). Integration of environmental and human
               surveillance data indicate that WBS detection of 100 gc/L of
               SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was associated with a positivity
               rate of 4\% as detected by human surveillance in the wastewater
               catchment area, though confidence intervals were wide ($\beta$ ~
               8.99 ∗ ln(100); 95\% CI = 0.90-17.08; p < 0.05). Our data also
               suggest that early detection of COVID-19 surges based on
               correlations between viral load in wastewater and human disease
               incidence could benefit by increasing the wastewater sample
               collection frequency from weekly to daily. Coupling simpler and
               faster detection technology with more frequent sampling has the
               potential to improve the predictive potential of using WBS of
               SARS-CoV-2 for early detection of the onset of COVID-19.",

               pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. The weekly trend of
               hospitalisations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
               (STEMI) showed a 40\% reduction, but the proportion of STEMI

               unprecedented response rates in patients with
               relapsed/refractory (R/R) hematologic malignancies. Although
               CAR-T therapy gives hope to heavily pretreated patients, the
               rapid commercialization and cumulative immunosuppression of this
               therapy predispose patients to infections for a prolonged
               period. CAR-T therapy poses distinctive short- and long-term
               toxicities and infection risks among patients who receive CAR
               T-cells after multiple prior treatments, often including
               hematopoietic cell transplantation. The acute toxicities include
               cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated
               neurotoxicity syndrome. The long-term B cell depletion,
               hypogammaglobulinemia, and cytopenia further predispose patients
               to severe infections and abrogate the remission success achieved
               by the living drug. These on-target-off-tumor toxicities deplete
               B-cells across the entire lineage and further diminish immune
               responses to vaccines. Early observational data suggest that
               patients with hematologic malignancies may not mount adequate
               humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this
               review, we summarize the immune compromising factors indigenous
               to CAR-T recipients. We discuss the immunogenic potential of
               different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for CAR-T recipients based on the
               differences in vaccine manufacturing platforms. Given the lack
               of data related to the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2
               vaccines in this distinctively immunosuppressed cohort, we
               summarize the infection risks associated with Food and Drug
               Administration-approved CAR-T constructs and the potential
               determinants of vaccine responses. The review further highlights
               the potential need for booster vaccine dosing and the promise

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused significant healthcare service
               disruptions. Surgical backlogs have been estimated but not for
               other healthcare services. This study aims to estimate the
               backlog of preventive care services caused by COVID-19. METHODS:
               This observational study assessed preventive care screening
               rates at three primary care clinics in Ottawa, Ontario from
               March to November 2020 using data from 22,685 electronic medical
               records. The change in cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and
               type 2 diabetes screening rates were crudely estimated using
               2016 census data, estimating the volume of key services delayed
               by COVID-19 across Ontario and Canada. RESULTS: The mean
               percentage of patients appropriately screened for cervical
               cancer decreased by 7.5\% (- 0.3\% to - 14.7\%; 95\% CI),
               colorectal cancer decreased by 8.1\% (- 0.3\% to - 15.8\%; 95\%
               CI), and type 2 diabetes decreased by 4.5\% (- 0.2\% to - 8.7\%;
               95\% CI). Crude estimates imply 288,000 cervical cancer (11,000
               to 565,000; 95\% CI), 326,000 colorectal cancer (13,000 to
               638,000; 95\% CI), and 274,000 type 2 diabetes screenings
               (13,000 to 535,000; 95\% CI) may be overdue in Ontario.
               Nationally the deficits may be tripled these numbers. Re-opening
               measures have not reversed these trends. INTERPRETATION:
               COVID-19 decreased the delivery of preventive care services,
               which may cause delayed diagnoses, increased mortality, and
               increased health care costs. Virtual care and reopening measures
               have not restored the provision of preventive care services.
               Electronic medical record data could be leveraged to improve
               screening via panel management. Additional, system-wide primary
               care and laboratory capacity will be needed to restore
               pre-COVID-19 screening rates.",

  abstract  = "Interleukin6 (IL-6) is a key driver of hyperinflammation in
               COVID-19, and its level strongly correlates with disease
               progression. To investigate whether variability in COVID-19
               severity partially results from differential IL-6 expression,
               functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL-6 were
               determined in Chinese COVID-19 patients with mild or severe
               illness. An Asian-common IL-6 haplotype defined by promoter SNP
               rs1800796 and intronic SNPs rs1524107 and rs2066992 correlated
               with COVID-19 severity. Homozygote carriers of C-T-T variant
               haplotype were at lower risk of developing severe symptoms (odds
               ratio, 0.256; 95\% confidence interval, 0.088 to 0.739; P =
               0.007). This protective haplotype was associated with lower
               levels of IL-6 and its antisense long noncoding RNA IL-6-AS1 by
               cis-expression quantitative trait loci analysis. The differences
               in expression resulted from the disturbance of
               stimulus-dependent bidirectional transcription of the
               IL-6/IL-6-AS1 locus by the polymorphisms. The protective
               rs2066992-T allele disrupted a conserved CTCF-binding locus at
               the enhancer elements of IL-6-AS1, which transcribed antisense
               to IL-6 and induces IL-6 expression in inflammatory responses.
               As a result, carriers of the protective allele had significantly
               reduced IL-6-AS1 expression and attenuated IL-6 induction in
               response to acute inflammatory stimuli and viral infection.
               Intriguingly, this low-producing variant that is endemic to
               present-day Asia was found in early humans who had inhabited
               mainland Asia since ∼40,000 years ago but not in other ancient
               humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The present study
               suggests that an individual's IL-6 genotype underlies COVID-19
               outcome and may be used to guide IL-6 blockade therapy in Asian
               patients. IMPORTANCE Overproduction of cytokine interleukin-6
               (IL-6) is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and is believed to play
               a critical role in exacerbating the excessive inflammatory
               response. Polymorphisms in IL-6 account for the variability of
               IL-6 expression and disparities in infectious diseases, but its
               contribution to the clinical presentation of COVID-19 has not
               been reported. Here, we investigated IL-6 polymorphisms in
               severe and mild cases of COVID-19 in a Chinese population. The
               variant haplotype C-T-T, represented by rs1800796, rs1524107,
               and rs2066992 at the IL-6 locus, was reduced in patients with
               severe illness; in contrast, carriers of the wild-type haplotype
               G-C-G had higher risk of severe illness. Mechanistically, the
               protective variant haplotype lost CTCF binding at the IL-6
               intron and responded poorly to inflammatory stimuli, which may
               protect the carriers from hyperinflammation in response to acute
               SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results point out the possibility
               that IL-6 genotypes underlie the differential viral virulence
               during the outbreak of COVID-19. The risk loci we identified may
               serve as a genetic marker to screen high-risk COVID-19 patients.",

               operated on in pandemic hospitals under adequate conditions. We
               aimed to discuss the outcomes of our gastrointestinal cancer
               surgery patients and to present our patient management
               recommendations to resume operative treatment during the ongoing
               COVID-19 pandemic while taking into account hospital facilities.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 129 gastrointestinal
               cancer patients who underwent surgery between March 2020 and May
               2021 in the gastrointestinal surgery clinic of our hospital,
               which was assigned as a pandemic hospital in March 2020.
               Patients' demographic characteristics and preoperative and
               postoperative findings were recorded. RESULTS: Among the
               patients, 42.6\% (n = 55) were female and 57.3\% (n = 74) were
               male. The mean age was 61.89 $\pm$ 3.4 years. The primary tumor
               organs were the stomach 37.2\% (n = 48), pancreas 36.4\% (n =
               47), rectum 11.6\% (n = 15), colon 8.5\% (n = 11), and esophagus
               6.2\% (n = 8). The patients were treated with open (75.2\%, n =
               97) or minimally invasive surgery (24.8\%, n = 32; laparoscopic
               11.6\%, n = 15; robotic 13.2\%, n = 17). Eight patients tested
               positive for COVID-19 before surgery. No patients developed
               COVID-19 during postoperative intensive care or after being
               moved to the floor unit. There was no COVID-19-related morbidity

               express a nucleocapsid protein (N) that is essential for viral
               replication, transcription, and virion assembly. Phosphorylation
               of N from SARS-CoV by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is
               required for its function and inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium
               impairs N phosphorylation, viral transcription, and replication.
               Here we report that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein contains GSK-3
               consensus sequences and that this motif is conserved in diverse
               coronaviruses, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may be
               sensitive to GSK-3 inhibitors, including lithium. We conducted a
               retrospective analysis of lithium use in patients from three
               major health systems who were PCR-tested for SARS-CoV-2. We
               found that patients taking lithium have a significantly reduced
               risk of COVID-19 (odds ratio = 0.51 [0.35-0.74], P = 0.005). We
               also show that the SARS-CoV-2 N protein is phosphorylated by
               GSK-3. Knockout of GSK3A and GSK3B demonstrates that GSK-3 is
               essential for N phosphorylation. Alternative GSK-3 inhibitors
               block N phosphorylation and impair replication in SARS-CoV-2
               infected lung epithelial cells in a cell-type-dependent manner.

               decedents (N = 142,834) accessing acute healthcare services
               increased exponentially in proximity to death (hospitalizations
               = 4.7, EDVs = 3.9 months before death). This was inversely
               related to age, with changes among the youngest and eldest
               decedents at 6.6 and 3.5 months for hospitalizations and at 4.6
               and 3.3 months for EDVs, respectively. Healthcare use among
               cancer patients intensified earlier in life (hospitalizations =
               6.8, EDVs = 5.8 months before death). Decedents from respiratory
               diseases were most likely to access hospital-based services
               during the last month of life. No sex-based differences were
               found. The greater use of acute healthcare services among
               younger decedents and cancer patients suggests that policies
               potentiating primary care support targeting these at-risk groups
               may reduce pressure on hospital-based services.",

               spread to the pleura frequently occurs in patients with primary
               lung, breast, hematological, gastrointestinal, and gynecological
               cancers. These effusions tend to reaccumulate quickly, and the
               patient requires increasingly frequent thoracentesis. An
               indwelling pleural catheter allows for dramatic improvement in
               quality of life as the patient has the power to ease her/his own
               suffering by draining the effusion at home when shortness of
               breath and/or chest pain intensifies. Patients with MPE need
               home healthcare support to address symptom management related to
               complications of advanced metastatic cancer and antineoplasm
               treatment regimens. The financial obstacles for the home
               healthcare agency are explored by using agency supply costs, per
               visit costs, and the patient-driven groupings reimbursement mode
               grouper to estimate reimbursement. Care for a home healthcare
               patient with MPE costs Medicare approximately $64.50 per day,
               markedly less than costs for hospitalization and outpatient
               thoracentesis. Unfortunately, agencies must absorb the cost of
               vacuum drainage bottles. Whereas a small positive balance of
               $291 was estimated for the first 30-day posthospital episode,
               losses were estimated at $1,185 to $1,633 for subsequent 30-day
               episodes. Absorbing these costs has become extremely difficult

               This study aimed at comparing the data of our program in Brazil
               (2019 vs. 2020). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. RESULTS:
               One hundred and seventy-four PLT were performed in the period
               (93\% living donors). Patients were divided into two groups
               according to the LT date: pre-COVID-19 period
               (march/2019-February/2020) and COVID-19 period
               (March/2020-February 2021). In the pre-COVID-19 period, 97 LTs
               were performed, and 77 LTs were performed in the COVID-19
               period. Patients in the COVID-19 period were younger (10.9
               months vs. 16 months, p 0.009), had higher PELD scores (15 vs.
               14, p 0.04), more ascites (66.2 vs. 51.5\%, p 0.03), and more
               frequently hospitalized before LT (27.3 vs. 17.5\%). However,
               there was no difference in post-LT complications,
               retransplantation nor survival rates. Six (6.2\%) patients from
               pre-COVID-19 period were COVID positive at a median of 15.5
               months (14-17.5), and 6 (7.8\%) patients from COVID-19 period
               were COVID positive at a median of 3 months (20 days-6 months)
               from LT. There was neither mortality nor complications in those
               patients. Four (33\%) were hospitalized, and one had prolonged
               intubation. Four (33\%) were asymptomatic, 4 (33\%) had upper
               airways symptoms, and the remaining had gastrointestinal
               symptoms. CONCLUSION: Overall, PLT was not affected during
               COVID-19 period. Even though patients from COVID-19 period were
               sicker, there was no significant impact in LT outcomes. All the

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been difficult for families
               across the world due to fears about infection risk, increased
               social isolation, and significant changes in family roles and
               routines. Families with a child undergoing pediatric
               hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) may be at even greater
               risk for poor adjustment during COVID-19 given their child's
               increased risk for infection. The purpose of the current study
               was to qualitatively examine the impact of COVID-19 on family
               adjustment during pediatric HCT to inform clinical care.
               METHODS: Twenty-nine caregivers of children ($\leq$12 years) who
               underwent an HCT within the past 2 years completed
               semi-structured qualitative interviews and demographic
               questionnaires in the first 4 months following initial COVID-19
               quarantine. RESULTS: Twenty-two themes emerged from the
               interviews using grounded theory methodology. Although nearly
               half of caregivers described COVID-19 as a stressor, 69\% of
               caregivers reported adequate adjustment to COVID-19. Caregivers
               generally attributed their positive adjustment to HCT preparing
               the family for COVID-19 and more difficult adjustment to
               increased physical or social isolation and COVID-19 amplifying
               germ fears. The child's HCT treatment status also had important
               implications on family adjustment to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS:
               Results suggest that families undergoing pediatric HCT are
               uniquely prepared to cope with the impacts of a global pandemic;
               however, families experiencing certain risk factors (e.g., more
               recent transplant, impaired access to social support, reduced
               access to coping tools) may experience poorer adjustment during
               pandemics such as COVID-19 and may benefit from increased
               psychosocial support from their healthcare team.",

               respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
               This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Mathematical modeling is one of the
               most important tools that can speed up finding a drug or vaccine
               for COVID-19. COVID-19 can lead to death especially for patients
               having chronic diseases such as cancer, AIDS, etc. We construct
               a new within-host SARS-CoV-2/cancer model. The model describes
               the interactions between six compartments: nutrient, healthy
               epithelial cells, cancer cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles,
               cancer-specific CTLs, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We
               verify the nonnegativity and boundedness of its solutions. We
               outline all possible equilibrium points of the proposed model.
               We prove the global stability of equilibria by constructing
               proper Lyapunov functions. We do some numerical simulations to
               visualize the obtained results. According to our model,
               lymphopenia in COVID-19 cancer patients may worsen the outcomes
               of the infection and lead to death. Understanding dysfunctions
               in immune responses during COVID-19 infection in cancer patients

              PRESENTATION: Two cases presented with moderate COVID-19 viral
              infection, concomitant with acute myeloid leukemia and T acute
              lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Surprisingly, after the
              administration of COVID-19 supportive therapy, the cases showed
              disease remission after a follow-up period of 12 and 5 months,

               morbidity and mortality thus far. Considering the historical
               uses of high-voltage X-ray beams for unresolvable pneumonia, we
               aimed to assess whether low-dose whole-lung irradiation (WLI)
               could provide any benefits for patients with refractory COVID-19
               pneumonia. METHODS: Eleven patients with refractory COVID-19
               pneumonia were treated with WLI to a total dose of 1 Gy and
               compared to 11 patients in a matched control group from June to
               November 2020. The study's primary endpoint was improvement of
               chest X-ray severity score (CXRS), followed by changes in mean
               oxygen (O2) saturation and 28-day mortality as secondary
               endpoints. RESULTS: The final CXRS was significantly lower in
               the WLI group (8.7 $\pm$ 2.5) compared to the control group
               (12.3 $\pm$ 3.3) (P: 0.016). Change of CXRS from the first to
               the last chest X-ray was -2.2 $\pm$ 3.1 for the WLI group and
               0.7 $\pm$ 3.9 for the control group, which showed a trend for
               lower CXRS in the WLI group (U = 30, p: 0.085). Mean O2
               saturation showed insignificant improvement in the first 24
               hours after radiotherapy (mean difference: 2.5 $\pm$ 4.1,
               Z=-1.6, P value: 0.11). Overall survival after 28 days was 32\%
               in the WLI group and 11\% in the control group (P: 0.48). The
               reason for death in many patients was not merely respiratory
               failure, but also other adverse situations like pneumothorax,
               cardiogenic shock and pulmonary thromboembolism. CONCLUSIONS:
               Low-dose WLI could improve the CXR severity score and O2
               saturation in severely ill COVID-19 patients, but larger studies
               are required to determine its impact on mortality.",

               wearing a transparent N95 mask, 781 (78.1\%) in the general
               population, 109 general health care workers (88.6\%), and 38
               health care workers who are deaf or hard of hearing (84.4\%)

               opaque N95 mask. In the general population, 450 (45.0\%) felt
               positively about interacting with a health care worker wearing a
               transparent mask; 76 general health care workers (61.8\%) and 37
               health care workers who are deaf or hard of hearing (82.2\%)
               felt positively about wearing a transparent mask to communicate
               with patients. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this
               study suggest that transparent masks could help improve
               communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for
               individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing.",

               Because chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is induced during aging and
               CM, the relationships between CHI3L1 and SC2 were investigated.

               SC2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and viral
               spike protein priming proteases (SPP), that ACE2 and SPP are
               induced during aging, and that anti-CHI3L1, kasugamycin, and
               inhibitors of phosphorylation abrogate these ACE2- and
               SPP-inductive events. Human studies also demonstrate that the
               levels of circulating CHI3L1 are increased in the elderly and
               patients with CM, where they correlate with COVID-19 severity.

               COVID-19 in the U.S. based on patient, practice, and
               local/regional demographic and pandemic response features.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed real-world data from the
               American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry
               collected from electronic health record systems. Data
               represented 157 outpatient urological practices and 3,165
               providers across 48 U.S. states and territories, including
               3,297,721 unique patients, 12,488,831 total outpatient visits
               and 2,194,456 procedures. The primary outcome measure was the
               number of outpatient visits and procedures performed (inpatient
               or outpatient) per practice per week, measured from January 2019
               to February 2021. RESULTS: We found large (>50\%) declines in
               outpatient visits from March 2020 to April 2020 across patient
               demographic groups and states, regardless of timing of state
               stay-at-home orders. Nonurgent outpatient visits decreased more
               across various nonurgent procedures (49\%-59\%) than for
               procedures performed for potentially urgent diagnoses
               (38\%-52\%); surgical procedures for nonurgent conditions also
               decreased more (43\%-79\%) than those for potentially urgent
               conditions (43\%-53\%). African American patients had similar
               decreases in outpatient visits compared with Asians and
               Caucasians, but also slower recoveries back to baseline.
               Medicare-insured patients had the steepest declines (55\%),
               while those on Medicaid and government insurance had the lowest
               percentage of recovery to baseline (73\% and 69\%,
               respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides real-world
               evidence on the decline in urological care across demographic
               groups and practice settings, and demonstrates a differential

               a serious fungal infection, mucormycosis has been increasingly
               found in COVID-19-recovered patients. Colloquially known as
               'black fungus', mucormycosis commonly causes necrosis in the
               head and neck including the nose, paranasal sinuses, orbits, and

               causes high morbidity and mortality given that it progresses

               magnitude of the outbreak, the Indian Health Ministry has
               advised all states to declare mucormycosis an epidemic.
               Typically, the disease has been found to be linked to COVID-19

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The clinical relevance of antiphospholipid antibodies
               (aPLs) in COVID-19 is controversial. This study was undertaken
               to investigate the prevalence and prognostic value of
               conventional and nonconventional aPLs in patients with COVID-19.
               METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective observational study
               in a French cohort of patients hospitalized with suspected
               COVID-19. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-nine patients were
               hospitalized with suspected COVID-19, in whom COVID-19 was
               confirmed in 154 and not confirmed in 95. We found a significant
               increase in lupus anticoagulant (LAC) positivity among patients
               with COVID-19 compared to patients without COVID-19 (60.9\%
               versus 23.7\%; P < 0.001), while prevalence of conventional aPLs
               (IgG and IgM anti-$\beta$2 -glycoprotein I and IgG and IgM
               anticardiolipin isotypes) and nonconventional aPLs (IgA isotype
               of anticardiolipin, IgA isotype of anti-$\beta$2 -glycoprotein
               I, IgG and IgM isotypes of anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin,
               and IgG and IgM isotypes of antiprothrombin) was low in both
               groups. Patients with COVID-19 who were positive for LAC, as
               compared to patients with COVID-19 who were negative for LAC,
               had higher levels of fibrinogen (median 6.0 gm/liter
               [interquartile range 5.0-7.0] versus 5.3 gm/liter [interquartile
               range 4.3-6.4]; P = 0.028) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (median
               115.5 mg/liter [interquartile range 66.0-204.8] versus 91.8
               mg/liter [interquartile range 27.0-155.1]; P = 0.019).
               Univariate analysis did not show any association between LAC
               positivity and higher risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE)
               (odds ratio 1.02 [95\% confidence interval 0.44-2.43], P = 0.95)
               or in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 1.80 [95\% confidence
               interval 0.70-5.05], P = 0.24). With and without adjustment for
               CRP level, age, and sex, Kaplan-Meier survival curves according
               to LAC positivity confirmed the absence of an association with
               VTE or in-hospital mortality (unadjusted P = 0.64 and P = 0.26,
               respectively; adjusted hazard ratio 1.13 [95\% confidence

               0.67-5.01], respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19
               have an increased prevalence of LAC positivity associated with
               biologic markers of inflammation. However, LAC positivity at the
               time of hospital admission is not associated with VTE risk

               nodules in the Pre-COVID-19 and 7/8 (88\%) nodules in the
               COVID-19 groups, with no significant differences between
               cytological and histological diagnoses (P = .931). CONCLUSION:
               The new LBC-only protocol provided similar diagnostic accuracy

               identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans as attachment receptors

               infection. SARS-CoV-2 binding to and infection of epithelial
               cells was blocked by low molecular weight heparins (LMWH).
               Although dendritic cells (DCs) and mucosal Langerhans cells

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Unhealthy alcohol use (UAU) is known to disrupt
               pulmonary immune mechanisms and increase the risk of acute
               respiratory distress syndrome in patients with pneumonia;
               however, little is known about the effects of UAU on outcomes in
               patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To our knowledge, this is the
               first observational cross-sectional study that aims to
               understand the effect of UAU on the severity of COVID-19.
               OBJECTIVE: We aim to determine if UAU is associated with more
               severe clinical presentation and worse health outcomes related
               to COVID-19 and if socioeconomic status, smoking, age, BMI,
               race/ethnicity, and pattern of alcohol use modify the risk.
               METHODS: In this observational cross-sectional study that took
               place between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, we ran a
               digital machine learning classifier on the electronic health
               record of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via
               nasopharyngeal swab or had two COVID-19 International
               Classification of Disease, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes to
               identify patients with UAU. After controlling for age, sex,
               ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, insurance status, and presence
               of ICD-10 codes for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and
               diabetes, we then performed a multivariable regression to
               examine the relationship between UAU and COVID-19 severity as
               measured by hospital care level (ie, emergency department
               admission, emergency department admission with ventilator, or
               death). We used a predefined cutoff with optimal sensitivity and
               specificity on the digital classifier to compare disease
               severity in patients with and without UAU. Models were adjusted
               for age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and insurance
               status. RESULTS: Each incremental increase in the predicted
               probability from the digital alcohol classifier was associated
               with a greater odds risk for more severe COVID-19 disease (odds
               ratio 1.15, 95\% CI 1.10-1.20). We found that patients in the
               unhealthy alcohol group had a greater odds risk to develop more
               severe disease (odds ratio 1.89, 95\% CI 1.17-3.06), suggesting
               that UAU was associated with an 89\% increase in the odds of
               being in a higher severity category. CONCLUSIONS: In patients
               infected with SARS-CoV-2, UAU is an independent risk factor
               associated with greater disease severity and/or death.",

               provide data for future management of such crises. We compared

               to be rejected or postponed, nor any significant changes in
               fractionation schedules implemented. Nevertheless, there was a
               substantial drop in overall radiotherapy sessions in 2020
               following the first incidence wave of up to -25\% (in June) in
               comparison to previous years. For breast cancer, a maximum
               decline of sessions of -45\% (July) was recorded. Only a short

               at high risk for Covid-19 or its complications; participants
               were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two
               intramuscular injections of mRNA-1273 (100 $\mu$g) or placebo,
               28 days apart, at 99 centers across the United States. The
               primary end point was prevention of Covid-19 illness with onset
               at least 14 days after the second injection in participants who
               had not previously been infected with the severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The data cutoff
               date was March 26, 2021. RESULTS: The trial enrolled 30,415
               participants; 15,209 were assigned to receive the mRNA-1273
               vaccine, and 15,206 to receive placebo. More than 96\% of
               participants received both injections, 2.3\% had evidence of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, and the median follow-up was
               5.3 months in the blinded phase. Vaccine efficacy in preventing
               Covid-19 illness was 93.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 91.0
               to 94.8), with 55 confirmed cases in the mRNA-1273 group (9.6
               per 1000 person-years; 95\% CI, 7.2 to 12.5) and 744 in the

               146.8). The efficacy in preventing severe disease was 98.2\%
               (95\% CI, 92.8 to 99.6), with 2 cases in the mRNA-1273 group and
               106 in the placebo group, and the efficacy in preventing
               asymptomatic infection starting 14 days after the second

               the mRNA-1273 group and 498 in the placebo group. Vaccine
               efficacy was consistent across ethnic and racial groups, age
               groups, and participants with coexisting conditions. No safety
               concerns were identified. CONCLUSIONS: The mRNA-1273 vaccine

               caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2), which enters host cells through the cell surface
               proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2. METHODS: Using a variety of normal
               and malignant models and tissues from the aerodigestive and
               respiratory tracts, we investigated the expression and
               regulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. RESULTS: We find that ACE2
               expression is restricted to a select population of epithelial
               cells. Notably, infection with SARS-CoV-2 in cancer cell lines,
               bronchial organoids, and patient nasal epithelium induces
               metabolic and transcriptional changes consistent with
               epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including
               up-regulation of ZEB1 and AXL, resulting in an increased EMT
               score. In addition, a transcriptional loss of genes associated
               with tight junction function occurs with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
               The SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, is repressed by EMT through the
               transforming growth factor-$\beta$, ZEB1 overexpression, and
               onset of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. This
               suggests a novel model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in which
               infected cells shift toward an increasingly mesenchymal state,
               associated with a loss of tight junction components with acute
               respiratory distress syndrome-protective effects. AXL inhibition
               and ZEB1 reduction, as with bemcentinib, offer a potential
               strategy to reverse this effect. CONCLUSIONS: These observations
               highlight the use of aerodigestive and, especially, lung cancer
               model systems in exploring the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and
               other respiratory viruses and offer important insights into the
               potential mechanisms underlying the morbidity and mortality of

               reshaped the usual risk: benefit equilibrium that became a
               trade-off between the infection exposure risk for the patient
               (and for staff) and the risk associated with delaying or
               cancelling the nuclear medicine examination. This study aimed at
               quantifying the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown in France
               on nuclear medicine examination volume together with volume of
               examination cancellation and non-attendance. METHODS: We
               retrospectively assessed the volume of planned examinations from
               1 month before to 1 month after the first lockdown in French
               high-volume nuclear medicine departments (NMD) sharing the same
               information management system including both university
               hospitals, UH (n = 7), and cancer centres, CC (n = 2). RESULTS:
               The study enrolled 31,628 consecutive patients referred for a
               nuclear medicine examination performed or not (NMEP or NMEnP).
               The total volume of NMEP significantly dropped by 43.4\% between
               the 4 weeks before and after the starting of the lockdown. The
               comparison of the percentage of NMEP and NMEnP between UH and CC
               is significantly different (p < 0.001). The percentage of NMEP
               during the study was 67.9\% in UH vs 84.7\% in CC. Percentages
               of NMEnP in UH and CC were due respectively to cancellation by
               the patient (14.9 vs 7.4\%), cancellation by the NMD (9.5 vs
               3.4\%), cancellation by the referring physician (5.1 vs 4.4\%)
               and non-attender patients (2.7 vs 0.2\%). CONCLUSION: The study
               underlines the public health issue caused by COVID-19 above the

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019
               (COVID-19) has rapidly spread throughout the world. During
               treatment, we found that the majority of patients had a decrease
               in hemoglobin (Hb). Interferon-$\alpha$2b (IFN-$\alpha$2b) was
               the primary suspected drug that was related to Hb reduction.
               Thus, the study aimed to investigate whether IFN-$\alpha$2b
               could induce Hb reduction in severe patients with COVID-19 and
               its potential mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 50
               patients who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of
               Harbin Medical University with severe COVID-19 infection were
               enrolled from February 12th to 24th, 2020. The demographics,
               baseline characteristics, clinical data, and therapeutic regimen
               were collected retrospectively. The patients were divided into
               two groups according to the declined use of IFN-$\alpha$2b on
               day 14. The Hb levels on admission, day 7, day14, and day 21
               were collected and analyzed. The primary endpoint was the level
               of Hb on day 21. RESULTS: A total of 31 patients in the IFN-stop
               group and 19 patients in the non-IFN-stop group were reviewed.
               The age, gender, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, nutritional
               status, disease severity, complications, and other factors of
               the patients were compared, no difference was found between the
               IFN-stop group and the non-IFN-stop group. The Hb levels of all
               patients significantly decreased on day 7 compared with that on
               admission (p < .0001). In the IFN-stop group, the Hb level was
               increased in 7 days after IFN-$\alpha$2b was stopped (p =
               .0008), whereas no difference was found between day 14 and day
               21 in the non-IFN-stop group (p = .3152). CONCLUSIONS:
               IFN-$\alpha$2b was associated with Hb reduction in the treatment

               height of the pandemic. METHODS: Patients operated on for or
               diagnosed with malignancies of the abdomen, breast, skin, or
               soft-tissue (September 3, 2020-September 6, 2020) were
               identified from operative/clinic schedules. Sociodemographics,
               tumor and treatment characteristics, and COVID-19 information
               was identified through retrospective chart review of a
               prospectively maintained database. Descriptive statistics were
               calculated. RESULTS: Fifty patients evaluated within this window
               underwent oncologic surgery. Median age was 61 (interquartile
               range: 53-68), 56\% were female, 86\% were White, and 66\% were

               Here, we report that Xanthohumol, a small molecule in clinical
               trials from hops (Humulus lupulus), was a potent pan-inhibitor
               for various coronaviruses by targeting Mpro, for example,

               alphacoronavirus PEDV (IC50 value of 7.51 $\mu$M). Xanthohumol
               inhibited Mpro activities in the enzymatical assays, while
               pretreatment with Xanthohumol restricted the SARS-CoV-2 and PEDV

               (n = 53) who were on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy to a

               Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67\% of patients with
               cancer after the first immunization, followed by a threefold
               increase in median titers after the second dose. Similar

               antibodies and T cells, but the magnitude of each of these

               sustainability of PCR-based surveillance testing in areas with
               receding and consistently low community COVID-19 rates. METHODS:
               The study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center in NYC
               from 22 March to 22 August 2020. Asymptomatic patients underwent
               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
               testing before surgeries, interventional radiology procedures,
               and endoscopy. Contact tracing in procedural areas was done if a
               patient with an initial negative screen retested positive within
               48 hours of the procedure. RESULTS: From March 22 until August
               22, 2020, 11 540 unique patients underwent 14 233 tests before
               surgeries or procedures at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
               Center. Overall, 65 patients were positive, with a peak rate of
               4.3\% that fell below 0.3\% after April 2020. Among the 65
               positive cases, 3 were presymptomatic and 38 were asymptomatic.
               Among asymptomatic test-positive patients, 76\% had PCR cycle
               threshold >30 at first detection. Five patients tested newly
               positive in the immediate postoperative period, exposing 82
               employees with 1 case of probable transmission (1.2\%).
               CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified
               on preprocedural surveillance was low in our study, which was
               conducted in an area with limited community spread at the later
               stage of the study. Universal PPE is protective in procedural
               settings. Optimal and flexible diagnostic strategies are needed
               to accomplish and sustain the goals of comprehensive
               preprocedure surveillance testing.",

               SARS coronavirus 2, which may guide drug repurposing options to

               complementary methods and multiphased design to pinpoint the
               most likely causal genes for COVID-19 severity. First, we
               applied cross-methylome omnibus (CMO) test and leveraged data
               from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) comparing 9,986
               hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 1,877,672 population
               controls. Second, we evaluated associations using the
               complementary S-PrediXcan method and leveraging blood and lung
               tissue gene expression prediction models. Third, we assessed
               associations of the identified genes with another COVID-19
               phenotype, comparing very severe respiratory confirmed COVID
               versus population controls. Finally, we applied a fine-mapping
               method, fine-mapping of gene sets (FOGS), to prioritize putative
               causal genes. RESULTS: Through analyses of the COVID-19 HGI
               using complementary CMO and S-PrediXcan methods along with
               fine-mapping, XCR1, CCR2, SACM1L, OAS3, NSF, WNT3, NAPSA, and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, the
               variant of concern 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in
               the UK. We aimed to estimate the risk of critical care
               admission, mortality in patients who are critically ill, and
               overall mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with
               non-B.1.1.7. We also compared clinical outcomes between these
               two groups. METHODS: For this observational cohort study, we
               linked large primary care (QResearch), national critical care
               (Intensive Care National Audit \& Research Centre Case Mix
               Programme), and national COVID-19 testing (Public Health
               England) databases. We used SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with
               S-gene molecular diagnostic assay failure (SGTF) as a proxy for
               the presence of lineage B.1.1.7. We extracted two cohorts from
               the data: the primary care cohort, comprising patients in
               primary care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported
               between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 26, 2021, and known SGTF status;
               and the critical care cohort, comprising patients admitted for
               critical care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported
               between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 27, 2021, and known SGTF status. We
               explored the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection with and
               without lineage B.1.1.7 and admission to a critical care unit
               (CCU), 28-day mortality, and 28-day mortality following CCU
               admission. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex,
               geographical region, other sociodemographic factors (deprivation
               index, ethnicity, household housing category, and smoking status
               for the primary care cohort; and ethnicity, body-mass index,
               deprivation index, and dependency before admission to acute
               hospital for the CCU cohort), and comorbidities (asthma, chronic
               obstructive pulmonary disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and
               hypertension for the primary care cohort; and cardiovascular
               disease, respiratory disease, metastatic disease, and
               immunocompromised conditions for the CCU cohort). We reported
               information on types and duration of organ support for the
               B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 groups. FINDINGS: The primary care
               cohort included 198 420 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of
               these, 117 926 (59·4\%) had lineage B.1.1.7, 836 (0·4\%) were
               admitted to CCU, and 899 (0·4\%) died within 28 days. The
               critical care cohort included 4272 patients admitted to CCU. Of
               these, 2685 (62·8\%) had lineage B.1.1.7 and 662 (15·5\%) died
               at the end of critical care. In the primary care cohort, we
               estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2·15 (95\% CI
               1·75-2·65) for CCU admission and 1·65 (1·36-2·01) for 28-day
               mortality for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with the
               non-B.1.1.7 group. The adjusted HR for mortality in critical
               care, estimated with the critical care cohort, was 0·91
               (0·76-1·09) for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with
               those with non-B.1.1.7 infection. INTERPRETATION: Patients with
               lineage B.1.1.7 were at increased risk of CCU admission and
               28-day mortality compared with patients with non-B.1.1.7
               SARS-CoV-2. For patients receiving critical care, mortality
               appeared to be independent of virus strain. Our findings

               presentation: A 59 years old female patient with a history of
               COVID-19 disease was admitted to our hospital due to her left
               upper quadrant abdominal and left flank pain. She had a history

               started for her. We also performed a thoraco-abdominopelvic
               computed tomography (CT) with intravenous and oral contrast.
               Total evidence suggests a splenic system infarction. A regular
               clinical examination for malignancy was performed on the patient
               and there was no evidence of cancer. Other probable reasons were
               ruled out. The patient was diagnosed with splenic infarction,

               University of Florence, between 1991 and 2021. Disease-specific
               frequencies were 1.3\% (39/2893), 1.2\% (21/1811) and 0.2\%
               (3/1888) for essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and
               primary myelofibrosis, respectively. Cerebral venous thrombosis
               occurred either prior to (n = 20, 27\%), at (n = 32, 44\%) or
               after (n = 22) MPN diagnosis. A total of 72\% of patients
               presented with headaches. Transverse (51\%), sagittal (43\%) and
               sigmoid sinuses (35\%) were involved with central nervous system
               hemorrhage noted in 10 (14\%) patients. In all, 91\% of tested
               patients harbored JAK2V617F. An underlying thrombophilic
               condition was identified in 19 (31\%) cases and history of
               thrombosis in 10 (14\%). Treatment for CVT included systemic
               anticoagulation alone (n = 27) or in conjunction with aspirin (n
               = 24), cytoreductive therapy (n = 14), or both (n = 9). At a
               median follow-up of 5.1 years (range 0.1-28.6), recurrent CVT
               was documented in three (4\%) patients while recurrent arterial
               and venous thromboses and major hemorrhage were recorded in
               11\%, 9\% and 14\%, respectively. Follow-up neurological
               assessment revealed headaches (n = 9), vision loss (n = 1) and
               cognitive impairment (n = 1). The current study lends clarity to
               MPN-associated CVT and highlights its close association with
               JAK2V617F, younger age and female gender. Clinical features that
               distinguish COVID vaccine-related CVT from MPN-associated CVT
               include, in the latter, lower likelihood of concurrent venous
               thromboses and intracerebral hemorrhage; as a result,
               MPN-associated CVT was not fatal.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Sedation for lumbar punctures (LPs) in pediatric
               acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients has been the
               standard for decades to reduce pain and anxiety. Recent studies
               on the potential long-term neurocognitive effects of cumulative
               propofol exposure have raised concerns about this practice. The
               recent pandemic introduced additional burdens to patients, with
               the requirement of a negative COVID-19 test prior to each
               sedated procedure. PROCEDURE: These factors prompted a quality
               improvement intervention at our institution where we aimed to
               reduce postinduction sedated LPs by 50\%. Our intervention
               included patient and family education, followed by a simulation
               of the procedure for selected patients. Those converted to
               unsedated LPs were queried for their preference. Comparative
               cost, clinical time, and LP success rates were collected for
               sedated and unsedated LPs. RESULTS: Following the intervention,
               the percentage of LPs performed with sedation dropped from 100\%
               to 48\%. All LPs were successful using both techniques. Most
               patients who experienced the unsedated LP technique, and their
               guardians, strongly preferred this approach. Unsedated LPs
               significantly reduced clinical time (169 vs. 83 minutes) for
               families, decreased expenditures (\$5736 reduction per
               procedure), and improved institutional opportunity cost due to a
               decrease in last-minute cancelations. CONCLUSION: We have shown
               that it is feasible to significantly reduce the use of sedation
               for LPs in patients with ALL, which has the potential to improve
               health and patient experience at a lower cost.",

               prospective study was carried out in patients with colorectal
               cancer scheduled for surgery at a tertiary care center. Wait
               list time was defined as the time from completion of diagnostic
               workup to definitive surgery and divided into 2-week intervals
               from 0 to 6 weeks. The outcome variables were 2-year and 5-year
               disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 602 patients, 364
               (60.5\%) male, median age 73 years (range = 71) were defined.
               The median wait list time was 28 days (range = 99). Two and
               5-year disease-free survival rates were 521 (86.5\%) and 500
               (83.1\%) respectively. There were no differences in 2-year or

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The public health crises that emerged in the
               COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the provision of
               medical care and placed sudden restrictions on ongoing clinical
               research. Patient-facing clinical research confronted unique
               challenges in which recruitment and study protocols were halted
               and then adapted to meet safety procedures during the pandemic.
               Our study protocol included the use of a Lung Cancer Screening
               Decision Tool (LCSDecTool) in the context of a primary care
               visit and was considerably impacted by the pandemic. We describe
               our experience adapting a multi-site clinical trial of the
               LCSDecTool within the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care
               System. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
               comparing the LCSDecTool to a control intervention. Outcomes
               included lung cancer screening (LCS) knowledge, shared
               decision-making, and uptake and adherence to LCS protocol. We
               identified three strategies that led to the successful
               adaptation of the study design during the pandemic: (1)
               multi-level coordination and communication across the
               organization and study sites, (2) flexibility and adaptability
               in research during a time of uncertainty and changes in
               regulation, and (3) leveraging technology to deliver the
               intervention and conduct study visits, which raised issues
               concerning equity and internal and external validity.
               CONCLUSION: Our experience highlights strategies successfully
               employed to adapt an intervention and behavioral research study
               protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience will
               inform clinical research moving forward both during and

               primarily responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and it
               is characterized by respiratory illness with fever and dyspnea.
               Severe vascular problems and several other manifestations,
               including neurological ones, have also been frequently reported,
               particularly in the great majority of ``long hauler'' patients.
               SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in lung epithelial cells,
               while dysfunction of endothelial and neuronal brain cells has
               been observed in the absence of productive infection. It has
               been shown that the Spike protein can interact with specific
               cellular receptors, supporting both viral entry and cellular
               dysfunction. It is thus clear that understanding how and when
               these receptors are regulated, as well as how much they are
               expressed would help in unveiling the multifaceted aspects of
               this disease. Here, we show that SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells
               express three important cellular surface molecules that interact
               with the Spike protein, namely ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP1. Their
               levels increase when cells are treated with retinoic acid (RA),
               a commonly used agent known to promote differentiation. This
               increase matched the higher levels of receptors observed on
               HUVEC (primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells). We also
               show by confocal imaging that replication-defective
               pseudoviruses carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can infect
               differentiated and undifferentiated SH-SY5Y, and HUVEC cells,
               although with different efficiencies. Neuronal cells and
               endothelial cells are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection
               and the interaction of the Spike viral protein with these cells
               may cause their dysregulation. Characterizing RNA and protein
               expression tempo, mode, and levels of different SARS-CoV-2
               receptors on both cell subpopulations may have clinical
               relevance for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-infected
               subjects, including long hauler patients with neurological
               manifestations.",

               population. In this context, we evaluated the humoral response

               against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with Waldenstr{\"o}m

               enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methodology was
               implemented to evaluate NAbs on the day of the first vaccine
               shot, as well as on days 22 and 50 afterward. A total of 106
               patients with WM (43\% men; median age, 73 years) and 212
               healthy controls (46\% men; median age, 66 years) who were
               vaccinated during the same period at the same center were
               enrolled in the study (which is registered at
               www.clinicaltrials.gov as \#NCT04743388). Our data indicate that
               vaccination with either 2 doses of the BNT162b2 or 1 dose of the
               AZD1222 vaccine leads to lower production of NAbs against
               SARS-CoV-2 in patients with WM compared with controls on days 22
               and 50 (P < .001 for all comparisons). Disease-related immune
               dysregulation and therapy-related immunosuppression are involved
               in the low humoral response. Importantly, active treatment with
               either rituximab or Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors was
               proven as an independent prognostic factor for suboptimal
               antibody response after vaccination. In conclusion, patients
               with WM have low humoral response after COVID-19 vaccination,
               which underlines the need for timely vaccination ideally during
               a treatment-free period and for continuous vigilance on

               clustering had changed remarkably since June 2020. Apart from
               that the group of SNVs became dominant, which is represented by

               (ORF1ab:P4715L), a few emerging groups of SNVs were recognized
               with sharply increased monthly incidence ratios of up to 70\% in
               November 2020. Further investigation revealed sets of SNVs
               specific to patients' ages and/or gender, or strongly associated
               with mortality. Our logistic regression model explored features
               contributing to mortality status, including three critical SNVs,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: All diseases containing genetic material undergo
               genetic evolution and give rise to heterogeneity including
               cancer and infection. Although these illnesses are biologically
               very different, the ability for phylogenetic retrodiction based
               on the genomic reads is common between them and thus tree-based
               principles and assumptions are shared. Just as the different
               frequencies of tumor genomic variants presupposes the existence
               of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to
               computationally infer them, we postulate that the different
               variant frequencies in viral reads offers the means to infer
               multiple co-infecting sublineages. RESULTS: We present a common
               methodological framework to infer the phylogenomics from genomic
               data, be it reads of SARS-CoV-2 of multiple COVID-19 patients or
               bulk DNAseq of the tumor of a cancer patient. We describe the
               Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in
               each of the two scenarios.To demonstrate the accuracy of the
               method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We
               also make some additional discoveries. CONCLUSIONS: Concerti
               successfully extracts and integrates information from
               multi-point samples, enabling the discovery of clinically
               plausible phylogenetic trees that capture the heterogeneity
               known to exist both spatially and temporally. These models can
               have direct therapeutic implications by highlighting ``birth''
               of clones that may harbor resistance mechanisms to treatment,
               ``death'' of subclones with drug targets, and acquisition of
               functionally pertinent mutations in clones that may have seemed
               clinically irrelevant. Specifically in this paper we uncover new
               potential parallel mutations in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2
               virus. In the context of cancer, we identify new clones

               management of toxicities during chemotherapy for early stage
               breast cancer. DESIGN: Pragmatic, cluster randomised trial.
               SETTING: 20 cancer centres in Ontario, Canada, allocated by
               covariate constrained randomisation to remote management of
               toxicities or routine care. PARTICIPANTS: All patients starting
               adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast
               cancer at each centre. 25 patients from each centre completed
               patient reported outcome questionnaires. INTERVENTIONS:
               Proactive, standardised, nurse led telephone management of
               common toxicities at two time points after each chemotherapy
               cycle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome, cluster level
               mean number of visits to the emergency department or admissions
               to hospital per patient during the whole course of chemotherapy
               treatment, was evaluated with routinely available administrative
               healthcare data. Secondary patient reported outcomes included
               toxicity, self-efficacy, and quality of life. RESULTS: Baseline
               characteristics of participants were similar in the intervention
               (n=944) and control arms (n=1214); 22\% were older than 65
               years. Penetration (that is, the percentage of patients who
               received the intervention at each centre) was 50-86\%. Mean
               number of visits to the emergency department or admissions to
               hospital per patient was 0.91 (standard deviation 0.28) in the
               intervention arm and 0.94 (0.40) in the control arm (P=0.94);
               47\% (1014 of 2158 patients) had at least one visit to the
               emergency department or a hospital admission during
               chemotherapy. Among 580 participants who completed the patient
               reported outcome questionnaires, at least one grade 3 toxicity
               was reported by 48\% (134 of 278 patients) in the intervention
               arm and by 58\% (163 of 283) in the control arm. No differences
               in self-efficacy, anxiety, or depression were found. Compared
               with baseline, the functional assessment of cancer therapy trial
               outcome index decreased by 6.1 and 9.0 points in the
               intervention and control participants, respectively.
               CONCLUSIONS: Proactive, telephone based management of toxicities
               during chemotherapy did not result in fewer visits to the
               emergency department or hospital admissions. With the rapid rise
               in remote care because of the covid-19 pandemic, identifying
               scalable strategies for remote management of patients during

               practices regarding the optimal relationship between MAiD and PC
               services are not well developed. Multiple models are possible,
               including autonomous delivery of these services and formal or
               informal coordination, collaboration or integration. However, it
               is not clear which of these approaches are most appropriate,
               feasible or acceptable in different Canadian health settings in
               the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic
               period. The aim of this qualitative study is to understand the
               attitudes and opinions of key stakeholders from the government,
               health system, patient groups and academia in Canada regarding
               the optimal relationship between MAiD and PC services. METHODS

               semistructured interviews. Stakeholders with expertise and
               engagement in MAiD or PC who hold leadership positions in their

               provide their perspectives on the relationship between MAiD and

               tests not requiring trained personnel for primary care testing
               are essential. Saliva-based antigen rapid tests (ARTs) can
               fulfil this need, but these tests require overnight-fasted
               samples; without which independent studies have demonstrated
               sensitivities of only 11.7 to 23.1\%. Herein, we report an
               Amplified Parallel ART (AP-ART) with sensitivity above 90\%,
               even with non-fasted samples. The virus was captured
               multimodally, using both anti-spike protein antibodies and
               Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. It also featured
               two parallel flow channels. The first contained spike protein
               binding gold nanoparticles which produced a visible red line
               upon encountering the virus. The second contained signal
               amplifying nanoparticles that complex with the former and
               amplify the signal without any linker. Compared to existing dual
               gold amplification techniques, a limit of detection of one order
               of magnitude lower was achieved (0.0064 ng·mL-1). AP-ART
               performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva of COVID-19
               patients was investigated using a case-control study (139
               participants enrolled and 162 saliva samples tested). Unlike
               commercially available ARTs, the sensitivity of AP-ART was
               maintained even when non-fasting saliva was used. Compared to
               the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain
               reaction testing on nasopharyngeal samples, non-fasting saliva
               tested on AP-ART showed a sensitivity of 97.0\% (95\% CI:
               84.7-99.8); without amplification, the sensitivity was 72.7\%
               (95\% CI: 83.7-94.8). Thus, AP-ART has the potential to be
               developed for point-of-care testing, which may be particularly
               important in resource-limited settings, and for early diagnosis

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In Australia, ethics committees across different
               states vary in application, requirement and process for the
               ethical review and approval for clinical research. This may lead
               to confusion and delays in the enablement of multicentre
               research projects. This study explores the effect of differing
               processes for Ethics and Governance in the establishment of the
               CovidSurg-Cancer study during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
               METHODS: An anonymous, structured web-based questionnaire was
               designed using the Research Electronic Data Capture application
               (REDCap) platform to capture consultant surgeons, fellows, and
               trainees experience in the ethics application process.
               'CovidSurg-Cancer' was an international multicentre
               collaborative study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the
               outcomes of patients undergoing cancer surgery. The ethics
               process to set up this observational study was used as to
               explore the differing processes applied across Australia.
               RESULTS: The CovidSurg-Cancer study was successfully set up in
               14 hospitals. Four hospitals approved the study directly as an
               audit. Of the remaining sites, 10 ethics applications underwent
               Human Research Ethics Committee review following which two
               (14\%) were subsequently approved as an audit activity and eight
               hospitals (57\%) were given formal ethical approval with waiver
               of consent. Ethics application acceptance from another
               Australian Human Research Ethics Committee was provided with six
               applications; however, only three were reciprocated without the
               requirement for further agreements. A third of (30\%)
               respondents suggested that the details of the application
               pathway, process and documentation were unclear. CONCLUSION:
               Ethics processes are varied across Australia with considerable
               repetition. A centralized, harmonized application process would
               enhance collaborative research.",

               SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and potential co-pathogens

               was developed to identify the metagenome diversity by SARS-CoV-2
               diagnosis (npositive = 65; nnegative = 60), symptomatology
               status (nsymptomatic = 71; nasymptomatic = 54) and anatomical

               individuals. Furthermore, the workflow was able to identify
               putative respiratory co-pathogens, and the SARS-CoV-2 lineage
               across 29 samples. The diversity analysis showed a significant
               shift in the DNA-metagenome by symptomatology status and
               anatomical swabbing site. Additionally, metagenomic diversity
               differed between SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected asymptomatic
               individuals. While 31 co-pathogens were identified in SARS-CoV-2
               infected patients, no significant increase in pathogen or
               associated reads were noted when compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative
               patients. The Alpha SARS-CoV-2 VOC and 2 variants of interest
               (Zeta) were successfully identified for the first time using a
               clinical metagenomics approach. The metagenomics pipeline showed
               a sensitivity of 86\% and a specificity of 72\% for the
               detection of SARS-CoV-2. Clinical metagenomics can be employed
               to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants and respiratory co-pathogens
               potentially contributing to COVID-19 symptoms. The overall
               diversity analysis suggests a complex set of microorganisms with
               different genomic abundance profiles in SARS-CoV-2 infected
               patients compared to healthy controls. More studies are needed
               to correlate severity of COVID-19 disease in relation to
               potential disbyosis in the upper respiratory tract. A

               was evaluated using a nationwide registry: the COVID-19 Registry
               Japan. The inverse probability of weight treatment method was
               used to adjust for baseline confounders in the anticoagulation
               and non-anticoagulation groups. RESULTS: Of the 1748 patients
               included, anticoagulants were used in 367 patients (treatment
               group). The patients in the anticoagulant group were older,

               likely emerged from a zoonotic spill-over event and has led to a
               global pandemic. The public health response has been
               predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic
               individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other
               preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further
               spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic
               epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also
               been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses
               high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local
               and international transmission events, as well as the diversity
               of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse
               community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through
               bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic
               individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized
               that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can
               provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
               diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and
               sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater
               samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples
               represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of
               assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we
               undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data
               from 52 samples with >90\% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of
               sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in
               genomes sequenced from clinical patients. We identified 7973
               SNVs, of which 548 were ``novel'' SNVs that had not yet been
               identified in the global clinical-derived data as of 17th June
               2020 (the day after our last wastewater sampling date). However,
               between 17th of June 2020 and 20th November 2020, almost half of
               the novel SNVs have since been detected in clinical-derived
               data. Using the combination of SNVs present in each sample, we
               identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and
               compared them to lineages observed in North America prior to our
               sampling dates. The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data
               indicates there were more lineages circulating across the
               sampled communities than represented in the clinical-derived
               data. Principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in
               population structure based on genetic variation within the
               sequenced samples, with clear trends associated with increased
               diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals
               relative to the sampling dates. We demonstrate that genetic
               correlation analysis combined with SNVs analysis using
               wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot of the
               SARS-CoV-2 genetic population structure circulating within a
               community, which might not be observed if relying solely on
               clinical cases.",

               and morbidity. The high replication and transmission of
               SARS-CoV-2 are remarkably distinct from those of previous
               closely related coronaviruses, and the underlying molecular
               mechanisms remain unclear. The innate immune defense is a
               physical barrier that restricts viral replication. We report
               here that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 main protease targets RIG-I and
               mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein via two
               distinct mechanisms for inhibition. Specifically, Nsp5 cleaves
               off the 10 most-N-terminal amino acids from RIG-I and deprives
               it of the ability to activate MAVS, whereas Nsp5 promotes the
               ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation of MAVS. As
               such, Nsp5 potently inhibits interferon (IFN) induction by
               double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in an enzyme-dependent manner. A
               synthetic small-molecule inhibitor blunts the Nsp5-mediated

               SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins, thus restoring the innate
               immune response and impeding SARS-CoV-2 replication. This work
               offers new insight into the immune evasion strategy of
               SARS-CoV-2 and provides a potential antiviral agent to treat CoV

               evolving with better transmissibility. Understanding the
               molecular basis of the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host cells is
               of paramount significance, and development of antiviral agents
               provides new avenues to prevent and treat COVID-19 diseases.
               This study describes a molecular characterization of innate

               RT-PCR. These primers were specifically designed to confirm the
               deletion mutations $\Delta$69/$\Delta$70 in the spike and the
               $\Delta$106/$\Delta$107/$\Delta$108 in the NSP6 gene. We studied
               20 samples from positive patients, detected by using the Applied
               Biosystems TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher
               Scientific, Waltham, USA) that included the ORF1ab, S, and N
               gene targets. 16 samples displayed an S-negative profile
               (negative for S target and positive for N and ORF1ab targets)
               and four samples with S, N and ORF1ab positive profile. RESULTS:
               Our results emphasized that all S-negative samples harbored the
               mutations $\Delta$69/$\Delta$70 and
               $\Delta$106/$\Delta$107/$\Delta$108. This protocol could be used
               as a second test to confirm the diagnosis in patients who were
               already positive to COVID-19 but showed false negative results
               for S-gene. CONCLUSIONS: This technique may allow to identify
               patients carrying the VOC (202012/01) or a closely related
               variant, in case of shortage in sequencing.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether screening for sepsis using an
               electronic alert in hospitalized ward patients improves
               outcomes. The objective of the Stepped-wedge Cluster Randomized
               Trial of Electronic Early Notification of Sepsis in Hospitalized
               Ward Patients (SCREEN) trial is to evaluate whether an
               electronic screening for sepsis compared to no screening among
               hospitalized ward patients reduces all-cause 90-day in-hospital
               mortality. METHODS AND DESIGN: This study is designed as a
               stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial in which the unit of
               randomization or cluster is the hospital ward. An electronic
               alert for sepsis was developed in the electronic medical record
               (EMR), with the feature of being active (visible to treating
               team) or masked (inactive in EMR frontend for the treating team
               but active in the backend of the EMR). Forty-five clusters in 5
               hospitals are randomized into 9 sequences of 5 clusters each to
               receive the intervention (active alert) over 10 periods, 2
               months each, the first being the baseline period. Data are
               extracted from EMR and are compared between the intervention
               (active alert) and control group (masked alert). During the
               study period, some of the hospital wards were allocated to
               manage patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome of all-cause
               hospital mortality by day 90 will be compared using a
               generalized linear mixed model with a binary distribution and a
               log-link function to estimate the relative risk as a measure of
               effect. We will include two levels of random effects to account
               for nested clustering within wards and periods and two levels of
               fixed effects: hospitals and COVID-19 ward status in addition to
               the intervention. Results will be expressed as relative risk
               with a 95\% confidence interval. CONCLUSION: The SCREEN trial
               provides an opportunity for a novel trial design and analysis of
               routinely collected and entered data to evaluate the
               effectiveness of an intervention (alert) for a common medical
               problem (sepsis in ward patients). In this statistical analysis
               plan, we outline details of the planned analyses in advance of
               trial completion. Prior specification of the statistical methods
               and outcome analysis will facilitate unbiased analyses of these
               important clinical data. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

               infectious disease research is a critical component in efforts

               Intentional and effective community engagement methods are
               needed to improve BIPOC inclusion. We describe the methods
               utilized for the successful enrollment of BIPOC participants in
               the U.S. Government (USG)-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network
               (CoVPN)-sponsored vaccine efficacy trials and analyze the
               demographic and enrollment data across the efficacy trials to
               inform future efforts to ensure inclusive participation. Across
               the four USG-funded COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials for which
               data are available, 47\% of participants enrolled at CoVPN sites
               in the US were BIPOC. White enrollment outpaced enrollment of
               BIPOC participants throughout the accrual period, requiring the
               implementation of strategies to increase diverse and inclusive
               enrollment. Trials opening later benefitted considerably from
               strengthened community engagement efforts, and greater and more
               diverse volunteer registry records. Despite robust fiscal
               resources and a longstanding collaborative and collective
               effort, enrollment of White persons outpaced that of BIPOC
               communities. With appropriate resources, commitment and
               community engagement expertise, the equitable enrollment of
               BIPOC individuals can be achieved. To ensure this goal,
               intentional efforts are needed, including an emphasis on
               diversity of enrollment in clinical trials, establishment of
               enrollment goals, ongoing robust community engagement,

               that can be used to robustly quantify functionally similar TCRs

               to TCR data from COVID-19 patients, generating 1831 public TCR
               meta-clonotypes from the SARS-CoV-2 antigen-associated TCRs that
               have strong evidence of restriction to patients with a specific
               human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. Applied to independent
               cohorts, meta-clonotypes targeting these specific epitopes were
               more frequently detected in bulk repertoires compared to exact
               amino acid matches, and 59.7\% (1093/1831) were more abundant
               among COVID-19 patients that expressed the putative restricting

               issued emergency use authorization for monoclonal antibody (mAb)
               therapies for outpatients with COVID-19. The Commonwealth of
               Massachusetts issued guidance outlining the use of a reserve
               system with a lottery for allocation of mAbs in the event of
               scarcity that would prioritize socially vulnerable patients for
               20\% of the infusion slots. The Mass General Brigham health
               system subsequently implemented such a reserve system. RESEARCH
               QUESTION: Can a reserve system be deployed successfully in a
               large health system in a way that promotes equitable access to
               mAb therapy among socially vulnerable patients with COVID-19?
               STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of
               the operation of the reserve system for allocation of mAb
               therapies to identify how referrals moved through the allocation
               process and what proportion of patients who were offered and
               received mAb therapies were socially vulnerable. RESULTS:
               Notwithstanding multiple operational challenges, the reserve
               system for allocation of mAb therapy worked as intended to
               enhance the number of socially vulnerable patients who were
               offered and received mAb therapy. A significantly higher
               proportion of patients offered mAb therapy were socially
               vulnerable (27.0\%) than would have been the case if the
               infusion appointments had been allocated using a pure lottery
               system without a vulnerable reserve (19.8\%), and a
               significantly higher proportion of patient who received
               infusions were socially vulnerable (25.3\%) than would have been
               the case if the infusion appointments had been allocated using a
               pure lottery system (17.6\%) INTERPRETATION: Our health system

               follow-up (21\%). The overall attrition rate was 24\% and within
               the a priori projected attrition rate of 20\%-30\%. Considering
               the current historical context, this interim analysis is
               important because it will serve as baseline data on attrition
               prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research
               will compare these results with attrition throughout the rest of
               the study, allowing analysis of the effect of the COVID-19

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has spread substantially within India
               over multiple waves of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However,
               the risk factors and disease burden associated with COVID-19 in
               India remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess predictors of
               infection and mortality within an active surveillance study, and
               to probe the completeness of case and mortality surveillance.
               METHODS: In this prospective, active surveillance study, we used
               data collected under expanded programmatic surveillance testing
               for SARS-CoV-2 in the district of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India
               (population of 3 266 000 individuals). Prospective testing via
               RT-PCR was done in individuals with fever or acute respiratory
               symptoms as well as returning travellers, frontline workers,
               contacts of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, residents of
               containment zones, patients undergoing medical procedures, and
               other risk groups. Standardised data collection on symptoms and
               chronic comorbid conditions was done as part of routine intake.
               Additionally, seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G
               was assessed via a cross-sectional survey recruiting adults
               across 38 clusters within Madurai District from Oct 19, 2020, to
               Nov 5, 2020. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for
               positive RT-PCR results comparing individuals by age, sex,
               comorbid conditions, and aspects of clinical presentation. We
               estimated case-fatality ratios (CFRs) over the 30-day period
               following RT-PCR testing stratified by the same variables, and
               adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for death associated with age,
               sex, and comorbidity. We estimated infection-fatality ratios
               (IFRs) on the basis of age-specific seroprevalence. RESULTS:
               Between May 20, 2020, and Oct 31, 2020, 13·5 diagnostic tests
               were done per 100 inhabitants within Madurai, as compared to 7·9
               tests per 100 inhabitants throughout India. From a total of 440
               253 RT-PCR tests, 15 781 (3·6\%) SARS-CoV-2 infections were
               identified, with 8720 (5·4\%) of 160 273 being positive among
               individuals with symptoms, and 7061 (2·5\%) of 279 980 being
               positive among individuals without symptoms, at the time of
               presentation. Estimated aORs for symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed
               infection increased continuously by a factor of 4·3 from ages
               0-4 years to 80 years or older. By contrast, risk of
               asymptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed infection did not differ across
               ages 0-44 years, and thereafter increased by a factor of 1·6
               between ages 45-49 years and 80 years or older. Seroprevalence
               was 40·1\% (95\% CI 35·8-44·6) at age 15 years or older by the
               end of the study period, indicating that RT-PCR clinical testing
               and surveillance testing identified only 1·4\% (1·3-1·6\%) of
               all infections in this age group. Among RT-PCR-confirmed cases,
               older age, male sex, and history of cancer, diabetes, other
               endocrine disorders, hypertension, other chronic circulatory
               disorders, respiratory disorders, and chronic kidney disease
               were each associated with elevated risk of mortality. The CFR
               among RT-PCR-confirmed cases was 2·4\% (2·2-2·6); after age
               standardisation. At age 15 years or older, the IFR based on
               reported deaths was 0·043\% (0·039-0·049), with reported deaths
               being only 11·0\% (8·2-14·5) of the expected count.
               INTERPRETATION: In a large-scale SARS-CoV-2 surveillance
               programme in Madurai, India, we identified equal risk of
               asymptomatic infection among children, teenagers, and
               working-age adults, and increasing risk of infection and death
               associated with older age and comorbidities. Establishing
               whether surveillance practices or differences in infection
               severity account for gaps between observed and expected
               mortality is of crucial importance to establishing the burden of
               COVID-19 in India. FUNDING: The Bill \& Melinda Gates

               young/middle-aged men of South Asian ethnicity with mild
               COVID-19. METHODS: In total, we recruited 994 men (median age:
               34 years) post-COVID-19 diagnosis. Repeated cross-sectional
               surveys were conducted between May 2020 and January 2021 at six
               time points - day 28 (n = 327), day 80 (n = 202), day 105 (n =
               294), day 140 (n = 172), day 180 (n = 758), and day 280 (n =
               311). Three commercial assays were used to detect
               anti-nucleoprotein (NP) and neutralizing antibodies. T cell
               response specific for Spike, Membrane and NP SARS-CoV-2 proteins
               was tested in 85 patients at day 105, 180, and 280. RESULTS: All
               serological tests displayed different kinetics of progressive
               antibody reduction while the frequency of T cells specific for
               different structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins was stable over time.
               Both showed a marked heterogeneity of magnitude among the
               studied cohort. Comparatively, cellular responses lasted longer
               than humoral responses and were still detectable nine months
               after infection in the individuals who lost antibody detection.
               Correlation between T cell frequencies and all antibodies was
               lost over time. CONCLUSION: Humoral and cellular immunity
               against SARS-CoV-2 is induced with differing kinetics of
               persistence in those with mild disease. The magnitude of T cells
               and antibodies is highly heterogeneous in a homogeneous study
               population. These observations have implications for COVID-19
               surveillance, vaccination strategies, and post-pandemic

               with splenectomy followed by allogeneic SCT in 2013 after an

               Introduction: The coronavirus epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 from
               Wuhan at the end of 2019 had considerable impact on our lives.
               In the absence of specific therapy, some people have resorted to
               alternative therapies. Objective: The aim of our study was to
               explore the effect of the coronavirus epidemic on the patients'
               attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine. Method:
               We have performed anonymous questionnaire survey among patients
               of a Hungarian university hospital and a city hospital waiting
               for elective surgery between August 3, 2020 and December 18,
               2020. We received 279 questionnaires, the response rate was
               69.7\%. Results: As a result of the coronavirus epidemic, 91.4\%
               of the respondents did not change their opinion about
               complementary and alternative treatments, 8.2\% were more
               optimistic about them. 16.8\% of respondents were optimistic,
               25.4\% rejected, and 57.7\% did not form an opinion about the
               disease-preventing effect of complementary therapy. A quarter of
               respondents (24.7\%) had used complementary therapies in their
               lifetime, with only 10\% of respondents using such therapies to
               prevent coronavirus infection. As a result of the pandemic, no
               one started using complementary therapies. 55.6\% of the
               respondents used a herbal preparation during their lifetime. In
               the course of the epidemic, a high proportion of respondents
               (27.5\%) used herbal preparations; no correlation was found
               between the use of the treatment and the socio-demographic
               factors examined. The use of herbs was lower among cancer and
               thromboembolic patients. Conclusion: Based on our study, the use
               of complementary therapies presumably decreased due to the
               restrictions imposed in the epidemic, however, the use of herbs
               did not change significantly. One-tenth of the respondents used
               naturopathic cure to prevent coronavirus infection. Orv Hetil.

               samples present a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. So far, there
               is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 detection in Papanicolaou (Pap)
               smears. Nevertheless, clinicians could be exposed unaware to the
               coronavirus while performing and handling a Pap smear. We aimed
               to retrospectively evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
               cervical liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples in women who tested
               positive for a nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test. METHODS: From
               our laboratory database, we identified patients with data on a
               cervical cancer screening LBC sample paired with a positive
               nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test. Relevant LBC samples taken
               within an incubation period of 14 days and post-onset RNA
               shedding interval of 25 days were subsequently tested for
               SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: The study group
               consisted of 102 women. Of those, 23 LBC samples were tested.
               SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in one LBC sample from a 26-year-old
               asymptomatic woman taken six days before reporting headaches and
               knee arthralgia with a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
               test. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in
               cervical LBC samples at an early asymptomatic stage of COVID-19.
               In general, this finding is infrequent in asymptomatic women who
               tested SARS-CoV-2 positive within an incubation of 14 days and a
               post-onset RNA shedding period of 25 days. We fully support the
               current thinking that cervical LBC samples from asymptomatic
               women pose a low risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and can be handled
               in the frame of good microbiological practice and procedures.",

  abstract  = "Melatonin is a natural hormone that has been shown highly
               antioxidant effects. Consequently, it has been extensively
               studied for its therapeutic potential in several diseases such
               as insomnia, cardiovascular, Alzheimer, and certain types of
               cancers. Recently, it has been used to adjuvant treatment for
               COVID-19 patients. It is well-known that melatonin is highly
               hydrophobic, resulting in lower solubility. However, the
               molecular structure and dynamic behavior of the formation of
               melatonin in an aqueous solution and at the water-air interface
               have not yet been clearly explained. This information is
               necessary for the melatonin formulation in drug delivery
               systems. The present work focuses on the molecular structure and
               dynamics of melatonin molecules in the aqueous solution and at
               the water-air interface based on using a molecular dynamics
               simulation study. The results showed that most melatonin
               molecules were aggregated in an aqueous solution while they were
               formed a self-assembled monolayer with the ordered structure at
               the water-air interface. The strong interaction of melatonin
               depends on their functional group which showed a similar trend
               for both systems and was sequenced as follows: carbonyl O >
               indole NH > amide NH > methoxy OA, respectively. However, the
               carbonyl O and the indole NH groups exhibit strong interactions
               with water molecules at the interface. Consequently, the two
               preferred orientations of the melatonin head group can be
               observed at the water-air interface (i.e., one is to turn the
               head group to the water surface with the tilted angle of
               ~40°-60° and the second one is to turn the head group away from
               the water surface with the tilted angle of ~130°). The longer
               lifetime of hydrogen bonds formed between melatonin themselves
               in the bulk water reveals that the stability of melatonin
               aggregation in an aqueous solution is more stable. Therefore,
               melatonin has less soluble in an aqueous solution.",

               head and neck cancer, in order to reduce the use of medical
               resources. Currently, there are no established treatment
               guidelines for patients with head and neck cancer with
               synchronous esophageal cancer. CASE REPORT: We present a
               68-year-old male with cT4aN2cM0 oral floor and synchronous
               cT1bN1M0 esophageal cancers who had defective reconstruction
               following oral tumor resection before esophagectomy during the
               pandemic. At the initial surgery, the oral resected defect was
               reconstructed using supraclavicular artery flap. The subsequent
               esophagectomy was reconstructed by gastric tube reconstruction.
               Both postoperative courses were successful, without the need for
               postoperative ventilator use. The days from initial or second
               surgery to discharge were 14 or 16 days, respectively.

               patient with mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)
               undergoing brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and
               dacarbazine (A+AVD) therapy. A 43-year-old man presented to our
               hospital with a complaint of fever, for which he was diagnosed
               with COVID-19 after a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
               test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2), and antiviral therapy with favipiravir and
               ciclesonide was started subsequently. The fever persisted for
               the first few days of treatment, but his respiratory status was
               stable, and he became asymptomatic and afebrile on day 9.
               Although the PCR tests remained positive, he met the updated
               discharge criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) on day
               12. However, his fever recurred, and his condition worsened on
               day 16. A chest X-ray showed a new opacity. It is likely that
               favipiravir and ciclesonide treatment probably did not
               completely eliminate the virus in the patient, and therefore the
               infection persisted. We added remdesivir from day 21, and the
               improvement was remarkable. He was discharged on day 29 after
               two consecutive PCR test results were negative. PCR tests are
               not mandatory for the updated WHO discharge criteria. However,
               even after antiviral therapy, COVID-19 patients with hematologic
               malignancies may have prolonged active infection with impaired
               viral excretion. Depending on the background disease and
               comorbidities, there may be some patient populations for whom it
               is not appropriate to simply comply with the current discharge
               criteria. Therefore, more emphasis may be needed on PCR
               examinations.",

               the spike (S) protein, which is required for the recognition of
               host-cell receptors and thus elicits neutralizing antibodies.
               Targeting conserved epitopes on the S protein offers the
               potential for pan-beta-coronavirus vaccines that could prevent
               future pandemics. We displayed five B-cell epitopes, originally
               identified in the convalescent sera from recovered severe acute
               respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients, on the surface of the
               cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and evaluated these formulations as
               vaccines. Prime-boost immunization of mice with three of these
               candidate vaccines, CPMV-988, CPMV-1173, and CPMV-1209, elicited
               high antibody titers that neutralized the severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in vitro and showed
               an early Th1-biased profile (2-4 weeks) transitioning to a
               slightly Th2-biased profile just after the second boost (6
               weeks). A pentavalent slow-release implant comprising all five
               peptides displayed on the CPMV elicited anti-S protein and
               epitope-specific antibody titers, albeit at a lower magnitude
               compared to the soluble formulations. While the CPMV remained
               intact when released from the PLGA implants, processing results
               in loss of RNA, which acts as an adjuvant. Loss of RNA may be a
               reason for the lower efficacy of the implants. Finally, although
               the three epitopes (988, 1173, and 1209) that were found to be
               neutralizing the SARS-CoV were 100\% identical to the
               SARS-CoV-2, none of the vaccine candidates neutralized the
               SARS-CoV-2 in vitro suggesting differences in the natural
               epitope perhaps caused by conformational changes or the presence
               of N-linked glycans. While a cross-protective vaccine candidate
               was not developed, a multivalent SARS vaccine was developed. The
               technology discussed here is a versatile vaccination platform
               that can be pivoted toward other diseases and applications that

               spring 2020 resulted in an approximate 50\% increase in
               all-cause mortality. Previously, risk factors such as age and
               ethnicity, were identified by studying COVID-related deaths
               only, but these were under-recorded during this period.
               OBJECTIVE: To use a large electronic primary care database to
               estimate the impact of risk factors (RFs) on excess mortality in
               England during the first wave, compared with the impact on total
               mortality during 2015-19. METHODS: Medical history, ethnicity,
               area-based deprivation and vital status data were extracted for
               an average of 4.8 million patients aged 30-104 years, for each
               year between 18-March and 19-May over a 6-year period
               (2015-2020). We used Poisson regression to model total mortality
               adjusting for age and sex, with interactions between each RF and
               period (pandemic vs. 2015-19). Total mortality during the
               pandemic was partitioned into ``usual'' and ``excess''
               components, assuming 2015-19 rates represented ``usual''
               mortality. The association of each RF with the 2020 ``excess''
               component was derived as the excess mortality ratio (EMR), and
               compared with the usual mortality ratio (UMR). RESULTS: RFs
               where excess mortality was greatest and notably higher than
               usual were age >80, non-white ethnicity (e.g., black vs. white
               EMR = 2.50, 95\%CI 1.97-3.18; compared to UMR = 0.92, 95\%CI

               illness, place of residence (London, care-home, most deprived).
               By contrast, EMRs were comparable to UMRs for sex. Although some
               co-morbidities such as cancer produced EMRs significantly below
               their UMRs, the EMRs were still >1. In contrast current smoking
               has an EMR below 1 (EMR = 0.80, 95\%CI 0.65-0.98) compared to
               its UMR = 1.64. CONCLUSIONS: Studying risk factors for excess
               mortality during the pandemic highlighted differences from
               studying cause-specific mortality. Our approach illustrates a
               novel methodology for evaluating a pandemic's impact by
               individual risk factor without requiring cause-specific
               mortality data.",

               adults with uncomplicated malaria or as chemoprophylaxis for
               preventing malaria in travelers. It is an inexpensive,
               efficacious, and safe drug frequently prescribed around the
               world. Following anecdotal evidence from 17 patients in the
               provinces of Quebec and Ontario, Canada, suggesting that
               malarone/atovaquone may present some benefits in protecting
               against COVID-19, we sought to examine its antiviral potential
               in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cellular models of
               infection. In VeroE6 expressing human TMPRSS2 and human lung
               Calu-3 epithelial cells, we show that the active compound
               atovaquone at micromolar concentrations potently inhibits the
               replication of SARS-CoV-2 and other variants of concern
               including the alpha, beta, and delta variants. Importantly,
               atovaquone retained its full antiviral activity in a primary
               human airway epithelium cell culture model. Mechanistically, we
               demonstrate that the atovaquone antiviral activity against
               SARS-CoV-2 is partially dependent on the expression of TMPRSS2
               and that the drug can disrupt the interaction of the spike
               protein with the viral receptor, ACE2. Additionally,
               spike-mediated membrane fusion was also reduced in the presence
               of atovaquone. In the United States, two clinical trials of
               atovaquone administered alone or in combination with
               azithromycin were initiated in 2020. While we await the results
               of these trials, our findings in cellular infection models
               demonstrate that atovaquone is a potent antiviral FDA-approved

               threatens our ability to achieve herd immunity for COVID-19.
               These novel SARS-CoV-2 variants often harbor multiple point
               mutations, conferring one or more evolutionarily advantageous
               traits, such as increased transmissibility, immune evasion and
               longer infection duration. In a number of cases, variant
               emergence has been linked to long-term infections in individuals
               who were either immunocompromised or treated with convalescent
               plasma. In this paper, we used a stochastic evolutionary
               modeling framework to explore the emergence of fitter variants
               of SARS-CoV-2 during long-term infections. We found that
               increased viral load and infection duration favor emergence of
               such variants. While the overall probability of emergence and
               subsequent transmission from any given infection is low, on a
               population level these events occur fairly frequently. Targeting
               these low-probability stochastic events that lead to the
               establishment of novel advantageous viral variants might allow
               us to slow the rate at which they emerge in the patient
               population, and prevent them from spreading deterministically
               due to natural selection. Our work thus suggests practical ways
               to achieve control of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections, which
               will be critical for slowing the rate of viral evolution.",

               from March 16th to May 11th, 2020 in metropolitan France. 20
               centres were solicited, of which 12 responded to the survey.
               RESULTS: 50\% of the centres increased their surgical activity,
               33\% decreased it and 17\% did not change it during containment.
               Some centres had to cancel (17\%) or postpone (33\%)
               patient-requested interventions due to fear of SARS-CoV-2. Four
               and 6 centres (33\% and 50\%) respectively cancelled and
               postponed interventions for medical reasons. In the usual

               METHODS: This study is a feasibility trial with progression to
               full-scale RCT, pending meeting pre-defined criteria, of the
               SPIN-SELF Program. Participants will be recruited from the
               ongoing SPIN Cohort ( http://www.spinsclero.com/en/cohort ) and
               via social media and partner patient organizations. Eligible
               participants must have SSc and low to moderate disease
               management self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic
               Disease (SEMCD) Scale score $\leq$ 7.0). Participants will be
               randomized (1:1 allocation) to the group-based SPIN-SELF Program
               or usual care for 3 months. The primary outcome in the
               full-scale trial will be disease management self-efficacy based
               on SEMCD Scale scores at 3 months post-randomization. Secondary
               outcomes include SEMCD scores 6 months post-randomization plus
               patient activation, social appearance anxiety, and functional
               health outcomes at 3 and 6 months post-randomization. We will
               include 40 participants to assess feasibility. At the end of the
               feasibility portion, stoppage criteria will be used to determine
               if the trial procedures or SPIN-SELF Program need important
               modifications, thereby requiring a re-set for the full-scale
               trial. Otherwise, the full-scale RCT will proceed, and outcome
               data from the feasibility portion will be utilized in the
               full-scale trial. In the full-scale RCT, 524 participants will
               be recruited. DISCUSSION: The SPIN-SELF Program may improve
               disease management self-efficacy, patient activation, social
               appearance anxiety, and functional health outcomes in people
               with SSc. SPIN works with partner patient organizations around
               the world to disseminate its programs free-of-charge. TRIAL

               similar to healthy controls, and are a known correlate of
               protection. Case report: A multiple myeloma patient developed
               protective anti-spike antibodies after vaccination (608 IU/mL),
               but nonetheless developed severe breakthrough COVID-19 just 10
               weeks following his second vaccination with mRNA-1273. Results:
               Sequencing of the viral isolate revealed an extensively mutated
               variant with 10 spike protein mutations, including E484Q and
               N440K. Serology testing showed a dramatic decline in anti-spike
               antibodies immediately prior to virus exposure. Conclusions:
               Multiple myeloma patients who do develop detectable antibody
               responses to vaccination may be at increased risk for
               breakthrough infections due to rapid decline in antibody levels.
               Viral variants with immune escape mutations such as N440K, also
               seen independently in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529)

               COVID lockdown period. METHODS: Changes in health were assessed
               through semi-structured interviews, gastrointestinal functional
               outcomes using Krickenbeck scoring and QoL by the modified
               disease-specific HAQL (Hirschsprung's disease anorectal
               malformation quality of life questionnaire). The State-Trait
               Anxiety Inventory (STAI)™ for adults was used to assess parental
               anxiety. RESULTS: Thirty-two families were interviewed; 19
               (59\%) reported no change in their child's health during the
               lockdown, 5 (16\%) a deterioration and 8 (25\%) an improvement.
               Neither the severity of the CCM, nor the degree of bowel
               dysfunction, correlated with any deterioration. The HAQL score
               was not correlated to a change in health. Anxiety scores ranged
               from no anxiety to clinical concerns. Telemedicine was well
               accepted by 28/32 parents (88\%); however, in-person
               appointments were preferred if there were clinical concerns.
               CONCLUSION: In the follow-up of children and adolescents with
               CCM during the first UK lockdown using telemedicine we found
               that over half had stable health conditions. Patients needing

               anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1. SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibody was immobilized on

               reported cases of pituitary tumor resolution due to viral
               illness. We present this case to further investigate the
               relationship between inflammatory response and tumor remission.
               CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old man in Yemen presented to the
               hospital with fever, low blood oxygen saturation, and shortness
               of breath. The patient was diagnosed with coronavirus disease
               2019. Past medical history included pituitary microadenoma that
               was diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging and secondary
               adrenal insufficiency, which was treated with steroids. Due to
               the severity of coronavirus disease 2019, he was treated with
               steroids and supportive care. Three months after his initial
               presentation to the hospital, brain magnetic resonance imaging
               was performed and compared with past scans. Magnetic resonance
               imaging revealed changes in the microadenoma, including the
               disappearance of the hypointense lesion and hyperintense

              However, the technology they currently use to facilitate these

              companies have developed new software to ease our new digital

              cognitive models. To test our method, we tested the compatibility
              of EPIC EMR (EPIC Care) and the NAVIFY Tumor Board for preparing
              MDT meetings. The identified mismatches are categorized in the
              HOT-fit model by Yusof et al, a common way to evaluate if a
              healthcare information system fits with the healthcare
              professionals and the organization. In total, 16 mismatches were

              with an implementation manager of the NAVIFY Tumor Board. The
              proposed method seems to be a fast and cheap method to gain
              useful insights in how well new software matches with the
              software currently in use, by comparing the cognitive models in
              place when performing tasks involved with specific scenarios. The

               misinterpretations. This occurs when the investigation is
               conducted to assess medical malpractice. An unexpected death,
               with no known apparent cause, is often linked to an underlying
               disease process of unclear etiological origin whose nature can,
               unfortunately, be properly investigated only post-mortem. This
               presentation shows a case study, in which it was possible to
               reconduct the death of a patient to a natural pathology and not
               to medical treatment. Here, the authors illustrate a case with a
               hamartoma developed in chronic inflammatory conditions
               (bronchiectasis) that was difficult to differentiate from lung
               cancer due to the inability to perform specific instrumental
               examinations. The hamartoma, usually benign and identifiable by
               standard instrumental investigations, in this case, led to the
               patient's death precisely during the execution of a
               bronchoscopy. However, in the absence of a certain cause of
               death, public opinion unanimously attributes a patient's disease
               to medical error. Indeed, a routine practice such as
               bronchoscopy should not cause death and consequently, the doctor
               must have made a mistake. Fortunately, the autopsy not only
               demonstrated the origin of the bleeding but also unveiled the
               reason for this, as rare congenital lung disease. Fate, one

               vaccines have shown high effectiveness in the prevention of
               symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, severe disease and death.
               Nevertheless, a minority of vaccinated individuals might become
               infected and experience significant morbidity. Characteristics
               of vaccine breakthrough infections have not been studied. We
               sought to portray the population of Israeli patients, who were
               hospitalized with COVID-19 despite full vaccination. METHODS: A
               retrospective multicentre cohort study of 17 hospitals included
               patients fully vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2
               vaccine who developed COVID-19 more than 7 days after the second
               vaccine dose and required hospitalization. The risk for poor
               outcome, defined as a composite of mechanical ventilation or
               death, was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were
               included, accounting for half of hospitalized fully vaccinated
               patients in Israel. Poor outcome was noted in 38 patients and
               mortality rate reached 22\% (34/152). Notably, the cohort was
               characterized by a high rate of co-morbidities predisposing to
               severe COVID-19, including hypertension (108; 71\%), diabetes
               (73; 48\%), congestive heart failure (41; 27\%), chronic kidney
               and lung diseases (37; 24\% each), dementia (29; 19\%) and
               cancer (36; 24\%), and only six (4\%) had no co-morbidities.
               Sixty (40\%) of the patients were immunocompromised. Higher
               viral load was associated with a significant risk for poor
               outcome. Risk also appeared higher in patients receiving
               anti-CD20 treatment and in patients with low titres of
               anti-Spike IgG, but these differences did not reach statistical
               significance. CONCLUSIONS: We found that severe COVID-19
               infection, associated with a high mortality rate, might develop
               in a minority of fully vaccinated individuals with multiple
               co-morbidities. Our patients had a higher rate of co-morbidities
               and immunosuppression compared with previously reported
               non-vaccinated hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. Further
               characterization of this vulnerable population may help to
               develop guidance to augment their protection, either by
               continued social distancing, or by additional active or passive

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a global impact on
               cancer care but the extent to which this has affected the
               management of colorectal cancer (CRC) in different countries is
               unknown. CRC management in Denmark was thought to have been
               relatively less impacted than in other nations during the first
               wave of the pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the
               pandemic's impact on CRC in Denmark. METHODS: The Danish
               national cancer registry identified patients with newly
               diagnosed with CRC from 1 March 2020 to 1 August 2020 (pandemic
               interval) and corresponding dates in 2019 (prepandemic
               interval). Data regarding clinicopathological demographics and
               perioperative outcomes were retrieved and compared between the
               two cohorts. RESULTS: Total CRC diagnoses (201 versus 359 per
               month, P = 0.008) and screening diagnoses (38 versus 80 per
               month, P = 0.016) were both lower in the pandemic interval. The
               proportions of patients presenting acutely and the stage at
               presentation were, however, unaffected. For those patients
               having surgery, both colonic and rectal cancer operations fell
               to about half the prepandemic levels: colon (187 (i.q.r.
               183-188) to 96 (i.q.r. 94-112) per month, P = 0.032) and rectal
               cancers (63 (i.q.r. 59-75) to 32 (i.q.r. 28-42) per month, P =
               0.008). No difference was seen in surgical practice or
               postoperative 30-day mortality rate (colon 2.2 versus 2.2 per
               cent, P = 0.983; rectal 1.0 versus 2.9 per cent, P = 0.118)
               between the cohorts. Treatment during the pandemic interval was
               not independently associated with death at 30 or 90 days.
               CONCLUSION: The initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced
               the number of new diagnoses made and number of operations but
               had limited impact on technique or outcomes of CRC care in

               mortality after elective digestive resections in a nationwide
               cohort during the lockdown period. METHODS: This analytic study
               was performed using a national billing database (the Programme
               de M{\'e}dicalisation des Syst{\`e}mes d'Informations). Patients
               who underwent elective digestive resections were divided in 2
               groups: the lockdown group defined by hospital admissions
               between March 17 and May 11, 2020; and the control group,
               defined by hospital admissions during the corresponding period
               in 2019. Groups were matched on propensity score, geographical
               region, and surgical procedure. The primary outcome was the
               postoperative mortality. RESULTS: The overall population
               included 15,217 patients: 9,325 patients in the control group
               and 5,892 in the lockdown group. The overall surgical activity
               was decreased by 37\% during the lockdown period. The overall
               in-hospital mortality during the hospital stay was 2.7\%. After
               matching and adjustment, no difference in mortality between
               groups was reported (OR = 1.05; 95\% CI: 0.83-1.34; P = .669).
               An asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was a risk factor for a
               2-fold increased mortality, whereas a symptomatic COVID-19
               infection was associated with a 10-fold increased mortality.
               CONCLUSION: Despite a considerable reduction in the surgical
               activity for elective digestive resections during the lockdown
               period, mortality remained stable on a nationwide scale in
               COVID-free patients. These findings support that systematic
               COVID-19 screening should be advocated before elective
               gastrointestinal surgery and that all efforts should be made to
               maintain elective surgical resection for cancer during the
               second wave in COVID-free patients.",

               Overall compared with those who received fresh grafts (n = 348),
               patients who received cryopreserved grafts (n = 135) had reduced

               recipients of cryopreserved matched-related donor HSCT showed

               Multivariable analysis of the entire cohort showed significant

               pneumonia have demonstrated mixed results, and the role of
               tocilizumab in combination with other treatments is uncertain.
               Here we evaluated whether tocilizumab plus remdesivir provides
               greater benefit than remdesivir alone in patients with severe
               COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind,
               placebo-controlled, multicenter trial included patients
               hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring > 6 L/min
               supplemental oxygen. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio)
               to receive tocilizumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously plus
               $\leq$ 10 days of remdesivir. The primary outcome was time from
               randomization to hospital discharge or ``ready for discharge''
               (defined as category 1, assessed by the investigator on a
               7-category ordinal scale of clinical status) to day 28. Patients
               were followed for 60 days. RESULTS: Among 649 enrolled patients,
               434 were randomly assigned to tocilizumab plus remdesivir and
               215 to placebo plus remdesivir. 566 patients (88.2\%) received
               corticosteroids during the trial to day 28. Median time from
               randomization to hospital discharge or ``ready for discharge''
               was 14 (95\% CI 12-15) days with tocilizumab plus remdesivir and

              the best approach to managing thyroid disorders during the
              coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The most frequent
              thyroid hormonal findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly
              in individuals with severe disease, are similar to those present
              in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome and require no
              intervention. Subacute thyroiditis has also been reported during
              COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism
              during the COVID-19 pandemic may follow usual practice; however,
              should avoid frequent laboratory tests in patients with previous
              controlled disease. Well-controlled hypo and hyperthyroidism are
              not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or
              severity. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during the pandemic
              should be preferably treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs),
              bearing in mind the possibility of rare side effects with these
              medications, particularly agranulocytosis, which requires
              immediate intervention. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism
              (radioiodine therapy or surgery) may be considered in those cases
              that protective protocols can be followed to avoid COVID-19
              contamination or once the pandemic is over. In patients with
              moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) not at risk of visual loss,
              glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive doses should be avoided,
              while in those with severe GO without COVID-19 and at risk of
              vision loss, intravenous glucocorticoid is the therapeutic
              choice. Considering that most of the thyroid cancer cases are low
              risk and associated with an excellent prognosis, surgical
              procedures could and should be postponed safely during the
              pandemic period. Additionally, when indicated, radioiodine
              therapy could also be safely postponed as long as it is possible.",

               functions. Here, we report that COVID-19-induced oxidative
               stress inflicts structural damages to HSA and is linked with
               mortality outcome in critically ill patients. We recruited 39
               patients who were followed up for a median of 12.5 days (1-35
               days), among them 23 had died. Analyzing blood samples from
               patients and healthy individuals (n=11), we provide evidence
               that neutrophils are major sources of oxidative stress in blood
               and that hydrogen peroxide is highly accumulated in plasmas of
               non-survivors. We then analyzed electron paramagnetic resonance
               spectra of spin-labeled fatty acids (SLFAs) bound with HSA in
               whole blood of control, survivor, and non-survivor subjects
               (n=10-11). Non-survivors' HSA showed dramatically reduced
               protein packing order parameter, faster SLFA correlational
               rotational time, and smaller S/W ratio
               (strong-binding/weak-binding sites within HSA), all reflecting
               remarkably fluid protein microenvironments. Following
               loading/unloading of 16-DSA, we show that the transport function
               of HSA may be impaired in severe patients. Stratified at the
               means, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that lower
               values of S/W ratio and accumulated H2O2 in plasma significantly
               predicted in-hospital mortality (S/W$\leq$0.15, 81.8\% (18/22)

               65.2\% (15/23) vs. 34.8\% (8/23), p=0.043). When we combined
               these two parameters as the ratio ((S/W)/[H2O2]) to derive a
               risk score, the resultant risk score lower than the mean
               (<0.019) predicted mortality with high fidelity (95.5\% (21/22)
               vs. 4.5\% (1/22), log-rank $\chi$2=12.1, p=4.9$\times$10-4). The

               international prospective cohort study including patients
               undergoing elective surgery in October 2020. Isolation was
               defined as the period before surgery during which patients did
               not leave their house or receive visitors from outside their
               household. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary
               complications, adjusted in multivariable models for measured
               confounders. Pre-defined sub-group analyses were performed for
               the primary outcome. A total of 96,454 patients from 114
               countries were included and overall, 26,948 (27.9\%) patients
               isolated before surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications
               were recorded in 1947 (2.0\%) patients of which 227 (11.7\%)
               were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who isolated
               pre-operatively were older, had more respiratory comorbidities
               and were more commonly from areas of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence
               and high-income countries. Although the overall rates of
               postoperative pulmonary complications were similar in those that
               isolated and those that did not (2.1\% vs 2.0\%, respectively),
               isolation was associated with higher rates of postoperative
               pulmonary complications after adjustment (adjusted OR 1.20,
               95\%CI 1.05-1.36, p = 0.005). Sensitivity analyses revealed no
               further differences when patients were categorised by:
               pre-operative testing; use of COVID-19-free pathways; or
               community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. The rate of postoperative
               pulmonary complications increased with periods of isolation
               longer than 3 days, with an OR (95\%CI) at 4-7 days or $\geq$ 8
               days of 1.25 (1.04-1.48), p = 0.015 and 1.31 (1.11-1.55), p =
               0.001, respectively. Isolation before elective surgery might be
               associated with a small but clinically important increased risk
               of postoperative pulmonary complications. Longer periods of
               isolation showed no reduction in the risk of postoperative
               pulmonary complications. These findings have significant

               adjusting for age, ethnicity and co-morbidities, a history of
               cancer was associated with increased mortality in wave one but
               not wave two. In summary, the second UK wave of COVID-19 is
               associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients. A
               history of solid cancer was not associated with increased
               mortality despite the dominance of the more transmissible
               B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. In both waves, metastatic disease
               and systemic anti-cancer treatment appeared to be independent
               risk factors for death within the combined cancer cohort.",

              of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of clinical services

              department of endocrine and general surgery at a teaching

              conducted of all patients who were operated in our department
              during two periods: 1 April to 31 October 2019 (pre-COVID-19
              period) and 1 April to 31 October 2020 (COVID-19 period). The
              perioperative clinical outcomes and productivity of our
              department for the two time periods were compared. RESULTS: In
              the pre-COVID-19 period, 130 operations were carried out, whereas
              in the COVID-19 group, this reduced to 89. The baseline
              characteristics between the two groups did not significantly
              differ. Parathyroid operations decreased significantly by 68\%
              between the two study periods. Overall, during the COVID-19
              phase, the department maintained 68\% of its operating workload
              compared with the respective 2019 time period. The clinical
              outcomes for the patients who had a thyroid/parathyroid/adrenal
              operation were not statistically different for the two study
              periods. There were no COVID-19 related perioperative
              complications for any of the operated patients and no patient
              tested positive for COVID-19 while an inpatient. For the COVID-19

              appointments for endocrine surgery and 26\% for general surgery

              reduced the clinical activity of our department. However, it is

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Following the official announcement of the COVID-19
               pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020
               and decreased activity of healthcare systems, relocation of
               resources, and the possible reluctance of patients to seek
               medical help, colorectal cancer patients were exposed to
               significant risks. Given that colon cancer is the third most
               common cancer and the second deadliest cancer in the world, its
               timely diagnosis and treatment are necessary to reduce costs and
               improve quality of life and patient survival. The aim of this
               study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the
               diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. METHODS AND
               MATERIALS: A comprehensive search performed on June 2021 in
               various databases, including Medline, Web of Science, and
               Scopus. Keywords such as ``diagnosis,'' ``treatment,''

               cancer `` was used individually or a combination of these words.
               All retrieved articles were entered into a database on EndNote
               X7. Then, studies were first selected by title and then by
               abstract, and at the end, full texts were investigated. RESULTS:
               Of the 850 studies, 43 were identified as eligible. According to
               studies, the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and the number of
               diagnostic procedures have decreased. Emergency visits due to
               obstruction or perforation of the large intestine or in advanced
               stages of cancer have increased, and a delay in the diagnosis of
               colorectal cancer has reported from 5.4 to 26\%. Treatment of
               colorectal cancer has also decreased significantly or has been
               delayed, interrupted, or stopped. This reduction and delay have
               been observed in all treatments, including surgery,
               chemotherapy, and long-term radiation therapy; only cases of
               emergency surgery and short-term radiotherapy has increased. The
               waiting time for hospitalization and the length of hospital stay
               after surgery has been reported to be higher. Changes in
               patients' treatment plans and complete to partial cessation of
               hospitals activities-that provided treatment services-were
               reported. CONCLUSION: According to the reduction in the
               diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer due to the COVID-19
               pandemic, compensating for the reduction and preventing the
               continuation of this declining trend, requires serious and
               effective interventions to prevent its subsequent consequences,
               including referrals of people with advanced stages and emergency
               conditions, increasing treatment costs and reducing the quality

  abstract  = "Background: The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene locus plays a
               fundamental role in human immunity, and it is established that
               certain HLA alleles are disease determinants. Previously, we
               have identified prevalent HLA class I and class II alleles,
               including DPA1*02:02, in two small patient cohorts at the
               COVID-19 pandemic onset. Methods: We have since analyzed a
               larger public patient cohort data (n = 126 patients) with
               controls, associated demographic and clinical data. By combining
               the predictive power of multiple in silico HLA predictors, we
               report on HLA-I and HLA-II alleles, along with their associated
               risk significance. Results: We observe HLA-II DPA1*02:02 at a
               higher frequency in the COVID-19 positive cohort (29\%) when
               compared to the COVID-negative control group (Fisher's exact
               test [FET] p = 0.0174). Having this allele, however, does not
               appear to put this cohort's patients at an increased risk of
               hospitalization. Inspection of COVID-19 disease severity
               outcomes, including admission to intensive care, reveal
               nominally significant risk associations with A*11:01 (FET p =
               0.0078) and C*04:01 (FET p = 0.0087). The association with
               severe disease outcome is especially evident for patients with
               C*04:01, where disease prognosis measured by mechanical
               ventilation-free days was statistically significant after
               multiple hypothesis correction (Bonferroni p = 0.0323). While
               prevalence of some of these alleles falls below statistical
               significance after Bonferroni correction, COVID-19 patients with
               HLA-I C*04:01 tend to fare worse overall. This HLA allele may

               work, high-throughput flow cytometry was instrumental to
               identify a consensus immune signature in COVID-19 patients, and
               to investigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 exposure on patients
               with either solid or hematological cancers. We provide here some
               examples of our 'holistic' approach, in which flow cytometry
               data generated by lymphocyte and myelomonocyte panels were
               integrated with other analytical metrics, including
               SARS-CoV-2-specific serum antibody titers, plasma
               cytokine/chemokine levels, and in-depth clinical annotation. We
               report how selective differences between T cell subsets were
               revealed by a newly described flow cytometric TDS assay to
               distinguish actively cycling T cells in the peripheral blood. By
               such approaches, our and others' high-content flow cytometry
               studies collectively identified overt abnormalities and subtle

               COVID-19 patients from those of healthy donors and patients with
               non-COVID respiratory infections. Thereby, these studies offered
               several meaningful biomarkers of COVID-19 severity that have the
               potential to improve the management of patients and of hospital
               resources. In sum, flow cytometry provides an important means
               for rapidly obtaining data that can guide clinical
               decision-making without requiring highly expensive,
               sophisticated equipment, and/or ``-omics'' capabilities. We

               is a challenging task to balance resources for treatment of
               COVID-19 and malignancy-based treatment. For the development of
               optimal strategies, assessing the conditions and constrains in
               treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic is pertinent. This study
               reported about a nationwide survey conducted by the Japan
               Society of Gynecologic Oncology. METHODS: We interviewed 265
               designated training facilities about the state of their clinical
               practice from the time period between March and December 2020.
               We asked the facility doctors in charge to fill a web-based
               questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 232 facilities (87.5\%)
               responded. A decrease in the number of outpatient visits was
               reported, and the major reason attributed was reluctance of
               patients to visit hospitals rather than facility restrictions.
               The actual number of surgeries decreased by 3.9\%, compared to
               2019. There was a significant difference when the variable of
               ``Prefectures operating under special safety precautions'' or
               not was introduced. There was no increase in the rate of
               advanced stages in the three cancer types studied. However,
               34.1\% participants perceived COVID-19 affected management and
               prognosis. CONCLUSION: Refraining from visiting hospitals based
               on the patient's judgment may be expected to be an issue in the
               future. No significant decrease in surgeries was observed, and
               it would seem that there were few forced changes in treatment
               plans, but ``the State of Emergency'' had an impact. There was
               no increase in the rate of advanced cancers, but this will need

               healthcare across the globe. It has been reported to have higher
               incidence and be associated with worse outcomes in patients with
               cancer. AIM: To examine the characteristics of patients with
               cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and to identify factors
               which may predict a poorer outcome. METHODS: Patients attending
               oncology services in Beaumont Hospital who were diagnosed with
               COVID-19 between March and May 2020 were included. Demographics
               and outcomes were determined by chart review. RESULTS:
               Twenty-seven patients were included in the study. The median age
               was 62; 59\% were male. Ten patients (37\%) died all of whom had
               metastatic or incurable locally advanced disease. Patients with
               lung cancer had a higher rate of COVID-19 and poorer outcomes.
               Those with a performance status (PS) $\geq$ 3 were more likely
               to die than those with PS $\leq$ 2. Compared to those who
               recovered, patients who died had a higher number of organs
               affected by cancer and a higher mean Palliative Prognostic
               Score. CONCLUSION: Patients attending oncology services during
               the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic had an increased rate
               of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a higher mortality rate than the
               general population. Those who died had more advanced cancer as
               demonstrated by poorer performance status, a greater burden of
               metastatic disease and a higher Palliative Prognostic Score.",

               cancer patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the two main

               transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is particularly frequent in cancer
               patients, who need to attend hospitals regularly. Since March,
               2020, all cancer patients having access to the Oncology Unit at
               the ``Andrea Tortora'' Hospital (Pagani, Salerno - referred to
               as ``the Hospital'') as inpatients or outpatients receiving
               intravenous therapy have been screened for SARS-CoV-2 using
               RT-PCR nasal swab. The ongoing COICA (COVID-19 Infection in
               Cancer Patients) study is an ambispective, multicenter,
               observational study designed to assess the prognosis of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. The aim of the study
               presented here was to explore potential differences in COVID-19
               related outcomes among screening-detected vs. non-screening
               detected SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: The COICA study
               enrolled cancer patients who had received any anti-cancer
               systemic therapy within 3 months since the day they tested
               positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. The target accrual is 128
               patients, and the study was approved by the competent Ethics
               Committee. Only the sub-group of patients enrolled at the
               Hospital was considered in this unplanned interim analysis.
               Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the
               association of screening-based vs. non screening based
               diagnosis. RESULTS: Since March, 15 2020 until August, 15 2021,
               a total of 931 outpatients and 230 inpatients were repeatedly
               screened for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR nasal swab at the Hospital.
               Among these, 71 asymptomatic patients were positive on routine
               screening and five patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 outside
               the institutional screening. Seven patients died because of
               COVID-19. At univariate analysis, non-screening vs. screening
               detected SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with significantly
               higher odds of O2 Therapy (OR= 16.2; 95\% CI =2.2 to 117.1; p
               =0.006),hospital admission (OR=31.5; 95\% CI=3.1 to 317.8;
               p=0.003 ), admission to ICU (OR=23.0; 95\% CI = 2.4 to 223.8; p=
               0.007) and Death (OR=8.8; 95\%CI= 1.2 to 65.5; p =0.034).
               CONCLUSION: Routine screening with RT-PCR may represent a
               feasible and effective strategy in reducing viral circulation
               and possibly COVID-19 mortality in patients with active cancer
               having repeated access to hospital facilities.",

               patients remains largely unexplored. Aim: This study aimed to
               investigate diagnostic and treatment delays related to isolation
               precautions, the associated patient outcome, and the
               predisposing risk factors for delays. Methods: This
               observational study was conducted in seven Helsinki region
               hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in
               Finland. The study used data on all non-COVID-19 inpatients, who
               were initially isolated due to suspected COVID-19, to estimate
               whether isolation precautions resulted in diagnostic or
               treatment delays. Results: Out of 683 non-COVID-19 patients, 33
               (4.8\%) had delays related to isolation precautions. Clinical
               condition deteriorated non-fatally in seven (1.0\%) patients.
               The following events were associated with an increased risk of
               treatment or a diagnostic delay: more than three ward transfers
               (P = 0.025); referral to an incorrect speciality in the
               emergency department (P = 0.004); more than three SARS-CoV-2
               RT-PCR tests performed (P = 0.022); and where cancer was the
               final diagnosis (P = 0.018). In contrast, lower respiratory
               tract symptoms (P = 0.013) decreased the risk. Conclusions: The
               use of isolation precautions for patients who did not have
               COVID-19 had minor negative effects on patient outcomes. The
               present study underlines the importance of targeting diagnostic
               efforts to patients with unspecified symptoms and to those with
               a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. Thorough investigations to
               achieve an accurate diagnosis improves the prognosis of patients

               patients with active cancers. Here we performed single-cell RNA
               sequencing in peripheral blood samples of 3 healthy donors
               (HDs), 4 COVID-19 patients (Covs) and 4 COVID-19 patients with
               active gynecological tumor (TCs) pre- and post- anti-tumor
               treatment. All Covs patients had recovered from their acute
               infection. Interestingly, the molecular features of PBMCs in TCs
               are similar to that in Covs, suggesting that convalescent
               COVID-19 with gynecologic tumors do not have major immunological
               changes and may be protected against reinfection similar to
               COVID-19 patients without tumors. Moreover, the chemotherapy
               given to these patients mainly caused neutropenia, while having
               little effect on the proportion and functional phenotype of T
               and B cells, and T cell clonal expansion. Notably, anti-PD-L1
               treatment massively increased cytotoxic scores of NK cells, and
               T cells, and facilitated clonal expansion of T cells in these
               patients. It is likely that T cells could protect patients from
               SARS-CoV-2 virus reinfection and anti-PD-L1 treatment can
               enhance the anti-viral activity of the T cells.",

               population undergoing systemic treatment with immune checkpoint
               inhibitors (ICIs) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we
               planned a clinical audit in 24 Italian institutions treating GU
               malignancies. Objective: The primary objective was investigating
               the clinical impact of COVID-19 in GU cancer patients undergoing
               ICI-based therapy during the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2
               contagion in Italy. Design setting and participants: The
               included centers were 24 Oncology Departments. Two online forms
               were completed by the responsible Oncology Consultants,
               respectively, for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and
               metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) patients receiving at
               least one administration of ICIs between 31 January 2020 and 30
               June 2020. Results and limitation: In total, 287 mRCC patients
               and 130 mUC patients were included. The COVID-19 incidence was,
               respectively, 3.5\%, with mortality 1\%, in mRCC patients and
               7.7\%, with mortality 3.1\%, in mUC patients. In both groups,
               40\% of patients developing COVID-19 permanently discontinued
               anticancer treatment. The pre-test SARS-CoV-2 probability in the
               subgroup of patients who underwent nasal/pharyngeal swab ranged
               from 14\% in mRCC to 26\% in mUC. The main limitation of the
               work was its nature of audit: data were not recorded at the
               single-patient level. Conclusion: GU cancer patients undergoing
               active treatment with ICIs have meaningful risk factors for
               developing severe events from COVID-19 and permanent
               discontinuation of therapy after the infection. Treatment delays
               due to organizational issues during the pandemic were unlikely
               to affect the treatment outcome in this population.",

               treatment or who had finished their oncologic treatment in the
               past 6 months, were retrospectively collected and analysed. For

               calculated to provide a score assessing the real weight of
               comorbidities on the patient's outcome at the time of diagnosis.
               It was discovered that these patients, besides the SCCHN,
               frequently presented at diagnosis with several other
               comorbidities, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiac
               arrhytmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and various

               SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in comparison to (health) anxiety related to

               institution who had a new diagnosis or relapse of their GN
               post-mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Results: Of 13 patients, 8
               patients were newly diagnosed with having GN and 5 patients had
               relapse. Median age was 62 years (range 19-83 years). Autoimmune
               disease (38\%) was the most prevalent underlying disease
               followed by cancer (23\%). Most patients were White males. IgA
               nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common GN in our series (5
               patients, 38\%) followed by membranous nephropathy (MN) (3
               patients, 23\%). There was 1 patient with IgAN who had evidence
               of IgA deposits before vaccination suggesting the immune
               activation after vaccination triggered a flare of the disease.

               can present shortly after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. New cases
               of IgAN may result from unmasking of undiagnosed IgAN owing to

               this review. Being a surfactant molecule, sophorolipid could
               solubilize the lipid envelope of SARS-CoV-2 and inactivate it.
               As an immunomodulator, sophorolipid could attenuate the cytokine
               storm caused by the SARS-CoV-2 upon infection, and inhibit the
               progression of COVID-19 in patients. Sophorolipids could also be
               used as an effective treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients
               suffering from cancer. However, there is limited research on the
               use of sophorolipid as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of
               cancer and viral diseases, and to modulate the immune response.
               Nevertheless, the multitasking capabilities of sophorolipids
               make them potential therapeutic candidates for the
               bench-to-bedside research for the treatment of COVID-19.",

               SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies in the blood of COVID-19
               patients. How obesity impacts the quality of the antibodies
               secreted, however, is not understood. Therefore, the objective
               of this study is to evaluate the presence of neutralizing versus
               autoimmune antibodies in COVID-19 patients with obesity.
               SUBJECTS/METHODS: Thirty serum samples from individuals who
               tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR were
               collected from inpatient and outpatient settings. Of these, 15
               were lean (BMI < 25) and 15 were obese (BMI $\geq$ 30). Control
               serum samples were from 30 uninfected individuals, age-,
               gender-, and BMI-matched, recruited before the current pandemic.
               Neutralizing and autoimmune antibodies were measured by ELISA.
               IgG autoimmune antibodies were specific for malondialdehyde
               (MDA), a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, and
               for adipocyte-derived protein antigens (AD), markers of
               virus-induced cell death in the obese adipose tissue. RESULTS:
               SARS-CoV-2 infection induces neutralizing antibodies in all lean
               but only in few obese COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection
               also induces anti-MDA and anti-AD autoimmune antibodies more in
               lean than in obese patients as compared to uninfected controls.
               Serum levels of these autoimmune antibodies, however, are always
               higher in obese versus lean COVID-19 patients. Moreover, because
               the autoimmune antibodies found in serum samples of COVID-19
               patients have been correlated with serum levels of C-reactive
               protein (CRP), a general marker of inflammation, we also
               evaluated the association of anti-MDA and anti-AD antibodies
               with serum CRP and found a positive association between CRP and
               autoimmune antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the
               importance of evaluating the quality of the antibody response in
               COVID-19 patients with obesity, particularly the presence of
               autoimmune antibodies, and identify biomarkers of self-tolerance
               breakdown. This is crucial to protect this vulnerable population
               at higher risk of responding poorly to infection with SARS-CoV-2
               than lean controls.",

               infections among a population of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients
               with cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective,
               multicenter, nationwide cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
               and infection among patients in the VA health care system from
               December 15, 2020, to May 4, 2021. All adults with solid tumors
               or hematologic cancer who received systemic cancer-directed
               therapy from August 15, 2010, to May 4, 2021, and were alive and
               without a documented SARS-CoV-2 positive result as of December

               based on age, race and ethnicity, VA facility, rurality of home
               address, cancer type, and treatment type/timing. Exposures:
               Receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The
               primary outcome was documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. A proxy for
               vaccine effectiveness was defined as 1 minus the risk ratio of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection for vaccinated individuals compared with
               unvaccinated controls. Results: A total of 184 485 patients met
               eligibility criteria, and 113 796 were vaccinated. Of these, 29
               152 vaccinated patients (median [IQR] age, 74.1 [70.2-79.3]
               years; 95\% were men; 71\% were non-Hispanic White individuals)
               were matched 1:1 to unvaccinated or not yet vaccinated controls.
               As of a median 47 days of follow-up, 436 SARS-CoV-2 infections
               were detected in the matched cohort (161 infections in
               vaccinated patients vs 275 in unvaccinated patients). There were
               17 COVID-19-related deaths in the vaccinated group vs 27
               COVID-19-related deaths in the unvaccinated group. Overall
               vaccine effectiveness in the matched cohort was 58\% (95\% CI,
               39\% to 72\%) starting 14 days after the second dose. Patients
               who received chemotherapy within 3 months prior to the first
               vaccination dose were estimated to have a vaccine effectiveness
               of 57\% (95\% CI, -23\% to 90\%) starting 14 days after the
               second dose vs 76\% (95\% CI, 50\% to 91\%) for those receiving
               endocrine therapy and 85\% (95\% CI, 29\% to 100\%) for those
               who had not received systemic therapy for at least 6 months
               prior. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, COVID-19
               vaccination was associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 infection rates
               in patients with cancer. Some immunosuppressed subgroups may
               remain at early risk for COVID-19 despite vaccination, and
               consideration should be given to additional risk reduction
               strategies, such as serologic testing for vaccine response and a
               third vaccine dose to optimize outcomes.",

  abstract  = "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
               the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a
               single-stranded RNA virus whose sequence is known. COVID-19 is
               associated with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype ranging from
               asymptomatic to fatal disease. It appears that access to
               nasopharyngeal respiratory epithelia expressing
               angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the receptor for
               SARS-CoV-2, is followed by viral replication in the pulmonary
               alveolar septal capillary bed. We have demonstrated in earlier
               studies that incomplete viral particles, termed pseudovirions,
               dock to deep subcutaneous and other vascular beds, potentially
               contributing to the prothrombotic state and systemic complement
               activation that characterizes severe and critical COVID-19. A
               variety of skin eruptions have been described in the setting of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection and more recently, after COVID-19
               vaccination. The vaccines deliver a laboratory-synthesized mRNA
               that encodes a protein that is identical to the spike
               glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, allowing the production of
               immunogenic spike glycoprotein that will then elicit T cell and
               B cell adaptive immune responses. In this contribution, we
               review an array of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 that
               provide an opportunity to study critical pathophysiologic
               mechanisms that underlie all clinical facets of COVID-19,
               ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe and critical COVID-19.
               We classify cutaneous COVID-19 according to underlying
               pathophysiologic principles. In this regard we propose three
               main pathways: (1) complement mediated thrombotic vascular
               injury syndromes deploying the alternative and mannan binding
               lectin pathways and resulting in the elaboration of cytokines
               like interleukin 6 from endothelium in the setting of severe and
               critical COVID-19 and (2) the robust T cell and type I
               interferon-driven inflammatory and (3) humoral-driven immune
               complex mediated vasculitic cutaneous reactions observed with
               mild and moderate COVID-19. Presented are novel data on
               cutaneous vaccine reactions that manifest a clinical and
               morphologic parallel with similar eruptions observed in patients
               with mild and moderate COVID-19 and in some cases represent
               systemic eczematoid hypersensitivity reactions to a putative
               vaccine-based antigen versus unmasking subclinical
               hypersensitivity due to immune enhancing effects of the vaccine.
               Finally, we demonstrate for the first time the localization of
               human synthesized spike glycoprotein after the COVID-19 vaccine
               to the cutaneous and subcutaneous vasculature confirming the
               ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to bind endothelium in
               the absence of intact virus.",

               are scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap and report the
               prevalence of eight comorbidities (high blood pressure, diabetes

               disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic
               heart failure) among patients attending PC during the onset of
               the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Community of Madrid (CoM), Spain.
               METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study that
               collects data registered in the CoM between February 25th and
               May 31st, 2020. Data are divided in two groups: Group-1
               (N=339,890) consist of all patients with suspected or proven
               SARS-CoV-2 infection; and Group-2 is the subgroup (N=48,556,
               14.3\% of Group-1) of individuals with COVID-19 confirmed by
               positive RT-PCR test. RESULTS: Comparing Group-1 with Group-2,
               339,890/48,556 patients, respectively, the main results were as
               follows: average age (60.9/69.9 years), presence of at least one
               comorbidity (33.51\%/47.69\%), high blood pressure
               (19.74\%/32.74\%), diabetes mellitus (7.13\%/13.75\%), cancer
               (6.56\%/10.6\%), cardiovascular disease (4.52\%/9.26\%), asthma
               (7.98\%/6.56\%), chronic kidney disease (1.84\%/4.41\%), chronic
               obstructive pulmonary disease (2\%/4.03\%), and chronic heart

               BCC cancer screening rates at year beginning and end were

               novel potential drugs in the treatment of diabetes,

               years and 76.6\% were male. The median time between symptoms
               onset and death was 36.5 days. The main comorbidities were
               arterial hypertension (13 patients, 43.3\%), dyslipidemia (11

               immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, or monoclonal
               antibodies until disease progression. Continuous therapy in
               combination with the underlying disease frequently results in
               severe humoral and cellular immunodeficiency, which often

               clinical management and immunological data of three
               multiple-myeloma patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Despite
               severe hypogammaglobulinemia, deteriorated T cell counts, and
               neutropenia, the patients were able to combat COVID-19 by
               balanced response of innate immunity, strong CD8+ and CD4+ T
               cell activation and differentiation, development of specific
               T-cell memory subsets, and development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 type
               IgM and IgG antibodies with virus-neutralizing capacities. Even
               12 months after re-introduction of lenalidomide maintenance

               remained detectable, indicating persisting immunity against
               SARS-CoV-2. We conclude that in MM patients who tested positive
               for SARS-CoV-2 and were receiving active MM treatment, immune
               response assessment could be a useful tool to help guide
               decision-making regarding the continuation of anti-tumor therapy
               and supportive therapy. KEY MESSAGES: Immunosuppression due to
               multiple myeloma might not be the crucial factor that is
               affecting the course of COVID-19. In this case, despite
               pre-existing severe deficits in CD4+ T-cell counts and IgA und
               IgM deficiency, we noticed a robust humoral and cellular immune
               response against SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of immune response and
               antibody titers in MM patients that were tested positive for
               SARS-CoV-2 and are on active MM treatment should be performed on
               a larger scale; the findings might affect further treatment
               recommendations for COVID-19, MM treatment re-introduction, and

               workers undergoing a SARS-CoV-2 serological test at our
               hospital, with a follow up of serology result three months

               enrolled from April 6 to May 7, 2020. Antibody response to
               SARS-CoV-2 was measured, and COVID-19 exposure routes were
               analyzed according to SARS-CoV-2 serological status. RESULTS: A
               total of 515 patients (34.4\%) were seropositive, mainly medical
               students (13.2\%) and assistant nurses (12.0\%). A history of
               COVID-19 exposure in a professional and/or private setting was
               mentioned by 83.1\% of seropositive subjects (P<0.05; odds ratio
               [OR]: 2.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-3.4). COVID-19
               exposure factors associated with seropositive status were
               non-professional exposure (OR: 1.9, 95\% CI: 1.3-2.7),
               especially outside the immediate family circle (OR: 2.2, 95\%
               CI: 1.2-3.9) and contact with a COVID-19 patient (OR: 1.6; 95\%
               CI: 1.1-2.2). Among professionally exposed workers, systematic
               adherence to strict hygiene standards was well observed, except
               for the use of a surgical mask (P<0.05, OR: 1.9, 95\% CI:
               1.3-2.8). Of those who reported occasionally or never wearing a
               surgical mask, nurses (25.7\%), assistant nurses (16.2\%), and

               prolonged demic has spread rapidly across the globe, resulting
               in more than 3 million deaths worldwide. The symptoms of
               Covid-19 are usually mild and non-specific, however in some
               cases patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome
               (ARDS) and systemic inflammation. Individuals with inflammatory
               or immunocompromising illnesses, such as cancer, are more
               susceptible to develop ARDS and have higher rates of mortality.
               This is mediated through an initial hyperstimulated immune
               response which results in elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
               cytokines and a subsequent cytokine storm. This potentiates
               positive feedback loops which are unable to be balanced by
               anti-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, elevated levels of
               IL-1$\beta$, as a result of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as
               well as IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$ amongst many others, contribute to
               the progression of various cancer types. Furthermore, Covid-19
               progression is associated with the depletion of CD8+ and CD4+ T

               patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, systemic
               tissue injury, and/or multi-organ failure leading to death in
               around 45\% of cases. There is a clear need for biomarkers which
               quantify tissue injury, predict clinical outcomes and guide the
               clinical management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS:
               We herein report the quantification by droplet-based digital PCR
               (ddPCR) of the SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and the plasmatic release of a
               ubiquitous human intracellular marker, the ribonuclease P (RNase
               P) in order to evaluate tissue injury and cell lysis in the
               plasma of 139 COVID-19 hospitalized patients at admission.
               RESULTS: We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was associated
               with clinical severity of COVID-19 patients. In addition, we
               showed that plasmatic RNase P RNAemia at admission was also
               highly correlated with disease severity (P<0.001) and invasive
               mechanical ventilation status (P<0.001) but not with pulmonary
               severity. Altogether, these results indicate a consequent cell
               lysis process in severe and critical patients but not
               systematically due to lung cell death. Finally, the plasmatic
               RNase P RNA value was also significantly associated with overall
               survival. CONCLUSION: Viral and ubiquitous blood biomarkers
               monitored by ddPCR could be useful for the clinical monitoring
               and the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover,
               these results could pave the way for new and more personalized
               circulating biomarkers in COVID-19, and more generally in

  abstract  = "Our goal was to address the safety of major gynaecologic cancer
               surgery without routine preoperative COVID-19 testing in the
               COVID-19 era. The databases of seven gynaecologic cancer centres
               were searched in order to identify all consecutive gynaecologic
               cancer patients undergoing major surgery between March 11, 2020
               and May 15, 2020 for this retrospective, case-control study. The
               case group consisted of patients with histopathologically
               confirmed gynaecologic cancers, and each case was matched with
               two counterparts who had undergone primary surgery before the
               COVID-19 pandemic. The case and the control groups were compared
               in terms of length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive
               care unit (ICU), intraoperative and postoperative
               complications.During the study period, 154 women with
               gynaecologic cancer undergoing major surgery were identified.
               Although the case group had more co-morbidities compared to the
               control group (103/154 vs. 178/308, respectively; p = .04), the
               median length of hospital stays, the rate of ICU admission,
               intraoperative complication rates and postoperative complication
               rates were similar in the two groups. Gynaecologic cancer
               surgery may be performed safely in the COVID-19 era with similar
               rates of ICU admission, intraoperative and postoperative
               complications compared to the patients operated before the
               COVID-19 pandemic.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this
               subject? Many societies have announced their guidelines about
               the surgical management of gynaecologic cancer patients during
               the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of them are not
               evidence-based and mostly on expert opinions.What do the results
               of this study add? The main findings of this retrospective,
               case-control study indicate that the short-term (30 day)
               outcomes of gynaecologic cancer patients undergoing major
               surgery in the COVID-19 era are similar to those who had been
               operated before the COVID-19 pandemic. The length of hospital
               stays, the rates of admission to the ICU, intraoperative and
               postoperative complications were comparable between women
               undergoing major gynaecologic cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era
               and the women who had been operated before the pandemic.What are
               the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or
               further research? We can suggest that definitive surgery may be
               performed for gynaecologic cancer patients in the COVID-19 era
               if the resources permit and appropriate precautions such as
               social distancing, isolation and the use of personal protective
               equipment are taken.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted routine screening
               for and treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. We analyzed
               changes in GI cancer pathology specimens resulting from
               diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at a single academic
               center in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our aim was to
               determine which cancer types, procedures, and patients were
               impacted by the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective,
               cohort study of patients identified based on carcinoma
               containing pathologic specimens reviewed by Mount Sinai
               Pathology Department resulting from diagnostic or resective
               procedures. Pathology and medical records of patients with GI
               and liver carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia were reviewed from
               February 1 to April 30 in 2018, 2019 and 2020. We used March 16,
               2020 to delineate the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 period in 2020.
               Chi-squared analyses or t-tests, as appropriate, were used to
               compare these time periods in each year. Mann Kendall test was
               used to test for trend in volume. ANCOVA was used to compare
               differences across years. RESULTS: A total of 1028 pathology
               samples from 949 unique patients were identified during the
               study period. There was a 57\% drop in samples within 2020
               (p=0.01) that was not present in either 2018 or 2019 (p<0.01).
               In 2020, there were significantly fewer resections compared to
               biopsies overall in the COVID-19 period (p=0.01). There were
               fewer colorectal cancer specimens (p=0.04) which were procured
               from older patients (p<0.01) in the 2020 COVID-19 period
               compared to pre-COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In our institution, there
               was a significant drop in diagnostic and resection specimens of
               GI cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic, disproportionately
               affecting colorectal cancer patients.",

               Longitudinal study within the prospective, multicenter UMBRELLA
               cohort of patients (being) treated for breast cancer. All cohort
               participants enrolled in UMBRELLA between October 2013 and
               November 2020 were sent a COVID-19-specific survey during the
               first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., April 2020
               and November 2020, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 1106
               (69.3\%) and 822 (50.9\%) cohort participants completed the
               survey in the first and second wave, respectively. The
               proportion of patients experiencing that their treatment or
               follow-up care was affected due to COVID-19 decreased from
               28.4\% (n = 198) in April 2020 to 14.8\% (n = 103) in November
               2020. Throughout the pandemic, one or more hospital
               consultations were postponed in 10.0\% (n = 82) of all patients
               and changed into a teleconsultation in 23.1\% (n = 190). The
               proportion of patients who experienced a higher threshold to
               contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19 decreased
               from 29.9\% (n = 204) in the first wave to 20.8\% (n = 145) in
               the second wave. In-person consultations remained most preferred
               in 35.2\% (n = 289) of all patients. Nearly half of all patients
               (48.3\%, n = 396) indicated that telehealth would be a useful
               alternative for in-person consultations in future. CONCLUSION:
               Perceived access to health care has improved substantially

               people worldwide have been infected with severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Uro-oncology
               (UO) patients are particularly vulnerable but in urgent need of
               life-saving systemic treatments. Our multicentric study examined
               the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the medical care of UO

               of the pre-defined follow-up assessment. METHODS: Data of 162 UO
               patients with metastatic disease undergoing systemic cancer
               treatment at five university hospitals in Germany were included
               in our analyses. The focus of interest was any delay or change
               in treatment between February 2020 and May 2020 (first wave of
               the COVID-19 crisis in Germany). Statistical analysis of
               contingency tables were performed using Pearson's chi-squared
               and Fisher's exact tests, respectively. Effect size was
               determined using Cram{\'e}r's V (V). RESULTS: Twenty-four of the
               162 patients (14.8\%) experienced a delay in systemic treatment
               of more than 2 weeks. Most of these received immuno-oncologic
               (IO) treatments (13/24, 54.2\%, p = 0.746). Blood tests were
               delayed or canceled significantly more often in IO patients but
               with a small effect size (21.1\%, p = 0.042, V = 0.230).
               Treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma (12/73, 16.4\%)
               and urothelial carcinoma (7/32, 21.9\%) was affected the most.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted
               the medical care of UO patients, but deferment remained modest.

               education, self-reported socioeconomic status, and location of
               residence as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES). We applied
               the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition approach to assess the role of
               socioeconomic inequality in COVID-19 mortality and determine the
               main contributors to the observed inequality. Overall, 941
               patients (48.96\%) had low SES, while only 24.87\% (n = 478)
               were classified in the high SES category. The mortality rate was
               significantly higher in the low SES group, and we spotted a
               17.13\% gap in COVID-19 mortality between the high and low SES
               patients (p < 0.001). Age was the main contributor to the
               observed inequality, responsible for 6.91\% of the gap (p <

               (LOS) in hospitals (0.95\%) in the low SES group were other main
               determinants of the inequality in COVID-19 mortality (p < 0.05).
               In the unexplained part of our model, the effect of increased
               age (10.61\%) and a positive RT-PCR test result (3.43\%) were
               more substantial in the low SES group compared to the high SES
               patients (p < 0.05). The low SES people had an increased risk of
               getting COVID-19, and the disease has been more severe and fatal
               among them. Increased age, co-morbidities, and LOS were

               (interquartile range (IQR), 53.0-73.0 years). One hundred six of
               the 193 patients (54.9\%) required hospitalization; among the
               hospitalized patients, 13 (12.3\%) required invasive mechanical
               ventilation, 39 (36.8\%) required ICU admission. Half of the
               cohort (49.2\%) had not received anti-cancer treatment prior to
               COVID-19 diagnosis. No patients requiring mechanical ventilation
               survived. Thirty-four of 193 (17.6\%) patients died of COVID-19
               complications. In multivariable analysis, hospitalization was
               associated with an age $\geq$ 65 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.12,
               95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11, 4.07), Black race (OR 2.53,
               CI 1.24, 5.32), performance status $\geq$2 (OR 3.67, CI 1.25,
               13.55) and $\geq$ 3 comorbidities (OR 2.00, CI 1.05, 3.84). Only
               former or current history of smoking (OR 2.75, CI 1.21, 6.22)
               was associated with death due to COVID-19 in multivariable
               analysis. Administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy within 90
               days of COVID-19 diagnosis was not predictive of COVID-19
               hospitalization (OR 0.83, CI 0.41, 1.68) or mortality (OR 1.56,
               CI 0.67, 3.53). CONCLUSIONS: The case fatality rate among
               patients with gynecologic malignancy with COVID-19 infection was
               17.6\%. Cancer-directed therapy was not associated with an
               increased risk of mortality related to COVID-19 infection.",

               COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Materials: From March 23, 2020,
               until June 30, 2020, complete lockdown was imposed in India.
               During this period there was restructuring of cancer care and
               radiation oncology department due to operational policies
               prevalent in the institution, and the care for gynecological
               cancer was based on the evolving international recommendations.
               Institutional review board approval was obtained to audit
               patterns of care during the complete lockdown phase. Descriptive
               variables were used to report on patient characteristics,
               compliance, delays, toxicity, and observed deviations in
               recommended care. Results: During the lockdown period spanning
               100 days, treatment of 270 and telephonic follow-up of 1103
               patients with gynecological cancer was undertaken. Of 270 new
               patients, due to travel restrictions, 90 patients were referred
               to the facilities in vicinity of their residence. Of the
               remaining 180 patients, 138 were planned for complete treatment
               at our institution and 42 were referred to our center for
               brachytherapy. Of 138 patients, only 106 (76\%) completed the
               planned external radiation. Twenty-four (26\%) patients
               completed full course of concurrent chemotherapy, 11 (12\%)
               received chemotherapy dose reduction, and 57 (62\%) received no
               concurrent chemotherapy. Treatment delay of up to 3 weeks was
               noted in 8.6\% patients due to COVID-19 infection. No grade 4 to
               5 acute sequelae were observed. No excess adverse effects were
               observed in high-risk population. Low rate of symptom burden was
               observed among 1103 patients on telephonic follow-up. With 100
               (9.6\%) patients reporting symptoms, among these, 54\% (54 of
               100) had complete resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks of
               teleconsultation, and 10\% had disease progression. Conclusions:
               Low compliance with planned treatment was observed for radiation
               and concurrent chemotherapy due to lockdown and fear of
               contracting COVID-19 and will likely lead to increased risk of
               cancer-related mortality. Rapid restructuring of care is needed
               to prevent the same as COVID-19 pandemic further evolves.",

              (COVID-19) in humans is warranted for understating the virus and
              developing preventive and therapeutic agents. Here, we
              characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse model expressing human (h)ACE2
              in mice, controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter, in
              the epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where SARS-CoV-2
              infections typically start. We found that intranasal inoculation
              with higher viral doses (2$\times$103 and 2$\times$104 PFU) of
              SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of
              various organs, including lung, liver, and kidney, while lower
              doses (2$\times$101 and 2$\times$102 PFU) led to less severe
              tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this
              hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues,
              with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was
              observed in post-mortem samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally,
              the mice that recovered from infection with a low dose of virus
              survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other
              existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most
              sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the
              information available about this model to include analysis of
              multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to
              human post-mortem samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion,
              the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and
              non-severe COVID-19 in humans being dose-dependent and can
              provide insight into disease progression and the efficacy of
              therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19. Importance The
              pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached
              nearly 240 million cases and caused nearly 5 million deaths
              worldwide as of October 2021, has raised an urgent need for the
              development of novel drugs and therapeutics to prevent the spread
              and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
              2 (SARS-CoV-2). To achieve this goal, an animal model that
              recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and
              pathogenesis is greatly needed. In this study, we have
              comprehensively characterized a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2
              infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the mice
              with low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenesis
              and survival in response to different infection patterns.
              Moreover, we compared the pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2
              transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients to show that
              this model could be a useful tool for the development of
              anti-viral drugs and therapeutics.",

               the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer and COVID-19 has
               become critically important. Objective: To compare the outcomes
               of patients with or without cancer who were diagnosed with
               COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with mortality,
               mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and
               hospitalization. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort
               study obtained data from the Optum de-identified COVID-19
               electronic health record data set. More than 500 000 US adults
               who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 1 to December 31,
               2020, were analyzed. Exposures: The patient groups were (1)
               patients without cancer, (2) patients with no recent cancer
               treatment, and (3) patients with recent cancer treatment (within
               3 months before COVID-19 diagnosis) consisting of radiation
               therapy or systemic therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures:
               Mortality, mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospitalization
               within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis were the main outcomes.
               Unadjusted rates and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of adverse
               outcomes were presented according to exposure group. Results: A
               total of 507 307 patients with COVID-19 were identified (mean
               [SD] age, 48.4 [18.4] years; 281 165 women [55.4\%]), of whom
               493 020 (97.2\%) did not have cancer. Among the 14 287 (2.8\%)
               patients with cancer, 9991 (69.9\%) did not receive recent
               treatment and 4296 (30.1\%) received recent treatment. In
               unadjusted analyses, patients with cancer, regardless of recent
               treatment received, were more likely to have adverse outcomes
               compared with patients without cancer (eg, mortality rate: 1.6\%
               for patients without cancer, 5.0\% for patients with no recent
               cancer treatment, and 7.8\% for patients with recent cancer
               treatment). After adjustment, patients with no recent cancer
               treatment had similar or better outcomes than patients without
               cancer (eg, mortality OR, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.84-1.02]; mechanical
               ventilation OR, 0.61 [95\% CI, 0.54-0.68]). In contrast, a
               higher risk of death (OR, 1.74; 95\% CI, 1.54-1.96), ICU stay
               (OR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.54-1.87), and hospitalization (OR, 1.19;
               95\% CI, 1.11-1.27) was observed in patients with recent cancer
               treatment. Compared with patients with nonmetastatic solid
               tumors, those with metastatic solid tumors and hematologic
               malignant neoplasms had worse outcomes (eg, mortality OR, 2.36
               [95\% CI, 1.96-2.84]; mechanical ventilation OR, 0.87 [95\% CI,
               0.70-1.08]). Recent chemotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy were
               also associated with worse outcomes (eg, chemotherapy mortality
               OR, 1.84 [95\% CI, 1.51-2.26]). Conclusions and Relevance: This
               cohort study found that patients with recent cancer treatment
               and COVID-19 had a significantly higher risk of adverse
               outcomes, and patients with no recent cancer treatment had
               similar outcomes to those without cancer. The findings have risk

               cancer were significantly reduced during the height of the surge
               of COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts. The safety of performing
               breast reconstruction during the pandemic was unknown. This
               study aims to review the safety of performing mastectomy with
               immediate breast reconstruction during the first COVID-19 surge
               in Massachusetts. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of
               patients who underwent mastectomy with immediate breast
               reconstruction by Massachusetts General Hospital breast and
               plastic surgeons immediately preceding and during the COVID-19
               pandemic was performed. RESULTS: Thirty patients (34 breasts)
               underwent mastectomies with immediate breast reconstruction
               during the COVID-19 restriction period in Massachusetts. Most
               reconstructions were unilateral. All reconstructions were
               performed with implants or expanders, and no autologous
               reconstructions were performed. Two patients (2 breasts) had
               operative complications. The complication rate during the
               pandemic was similar to the complication rate pre-pandemic. No
               patients or surgeons experienced symptoms or positive COVID-19
               tests. Over 90\% of patients were discharged the same day.
               CONCLUSION: Prosthetic breast reconstruction was able to be
               performed safely during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic
               surge in Massachusetts. Strict screening protocols, proper use
               of personal protective equipment, and same-day discharge when
               possible are essential for patient and surgeon safety during the

               system in Italy to implement an immediate reorganisation to
               support the care of tens of thousands of patients and to
               maintain the quality of care for patients with other
               pathologies, such as oncologic diseases. The main goal of this
               study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the
               hospitalisation and post-operative rehabilitation of head and
               neck oncologic patients and to determine whether the
               introduction of new technologies such as video-communication may
               be useful to mitigate social distancing by close family members.
               Methods: Fifty-one consecutive patients underwent surgery for
               head and neck cancer during the period of lockdown caused by the
               COVID-19 pandemic. The data collected (post-operative pain,
               post-operative complications, duration of hospitalisation) were
               compared with those of 51 consecutive patients treated for head
               and neck cancer in the period immediately preceding lockdown.
               Results: The average duration of hospitalisation was longer in
               patients operated on in the COVID-19 period, and, in particular,
               among patients who underwent a more demanding rehabilitation
               protocol. Despite this, our study did not show a significant
               difference in psychological aspects during hospitalisation.
               Conclusions: The greatest difficulties that occurred in the
               COVID-19 period were met by a greater commitment from medical
               staff, allowing the quality of life of head and neck cancer

               at a similar level to that before the pandemic. In the future,

               presenting to our institution before and during COVID-19.
               METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients with a new
               breast cancer diagnosis from March 2020-August 2020
               (during-COVID-19) were compared with March 2019-August 2019
               (pre-COVID-19). We compared stage at diagnosis,
               clinical/demographic features, and neoadjuvant therapy use
               between the time periods. RESULTS: A total of 573 patients
               included: 376 pre-COVID-19, 197 during-COVID-19. Method of
               cancer detection was by imaging in 66\% versus 63\% and by
               physical findings/symptoms in 34\% versus 37\% of patients

               with cN+ disease (p = 0.38). Neoadjuvant therapy use was
               significantly higher during-COVID-19 (39\%) versus pre-COVID-19
               (29\%, p = 0.02) driven by increased neoadjuvant endocrine
               therapy (NET) use (7\% to 16\%, p = 0.002), whereas neoadjuvant
               chemotherapy use did not change (22\% vs. 23\%, p = 0.72). In
               HR+/HER2- disease, NET use increased from 10\% pre-COVID-19 to
               23\% during-COVID-19 (p = 0.001) with a significant increase in

               decisions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis,
               decision making ultimately falls in the hands of patients-at
               present, their perspective is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To
               ascertain renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients' perspectives on
               COVID-19 and understand the associated implications for
               treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey
               of RCC patients was conducted from March 22 to March 25, 2020,
               disseminated through social media and patient networking
               platforms. The survey comprised 45 items, including baseline
               demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment-related
               information. Patients were additionally queried regarding their
               anxiety level related to COVID-19 and associated implications
               for their cancer diagnosis. INTERVENTION: An online survey
               study. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
               Descriptive statistics with graphical outputs were used to
               characterize survey results. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of
               539 patients (male:female 39\%:58\%) from 14 countries
               responded. Of them, 71\% felt that their risk of COVID-19
               infection was higher than the general population, and 27\%
               contacted their physician to establish this. Among patients with
               localized disease (40\%), most (42\%) had scheduled surveillance
               scans within 6 wk-65\% were unwilling to delay scans. Among
               patients with metastatic disease, 76\% were receiving active
               therapy. While most patients preferred not to defer therapy
               (51\%), patients receiving immune therapy regimens were less
               amenable to deferring therapy than those receiving targeted
               treatment (20\% vs 47\%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high levels of
               anxiety surrounding COVID-19, many patients with RCC were
               inclined to adhere to existing schedules of surveillance
               (localized disease) and systemic treatment (metastatic disease).
               PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
               pandemic has prompted many doctors to develop different
               treatment strategies for cancer and other chronic conditions.
               Given the importance of the patient voice in these strategies,
               we conducted a survey of patients with kidney cancer to
               determine their treatment preferences. Our survey highlighted
               that most patients prefer to continue their current strategies
               of kidney cancer treatment and monitoring.",

               health crisis. Another emerging challenge is the prevalence of
               ``black fungus'', or mucormycosis, among patients who recovered
               from COVID-19 infection. A retrospective study was conducted on
               12 patients in a post-COVID recovery phase who developed
               mucormycosis. The study parameters evaluated lymphocyte count,
               CD4+ T cell status, and associated systemic co-morbidities for
               the patient, namely diabetes. The interventions during the
               treatment for COVID were also recorded to include administration
               of oxygen, ventilator assistance (invasive and
               non-invasive)/oxygen support, and steroid use. The possible
               relationship between low lymphocyte and CD4+ counts with
               diabetes and fungal growth was evaluated. It was observed that
               the majority of the patients who had a positive history for
               diabetes with low lymphocyte and CD4+ counts were more
               susceptible to opportunistic fungal infections. Most of the
               patients, but not all, had a history of receiving oxygen or
               assisted ventilation, as well as steroids, during the treatment
               for COVID infection. These interventions may be considered as
               accessory contributing factors for fungal infection.
               Post-exposure to SARS-CoV-2, therapies should be targeted at
               prevention of functional exhaustion of lymphocytes and
               maintaining optimal lymphocyte and subset counts in susceptible
               hosts for the prevention of opportunistic fungal infections. The

               with multiple myeloma are at increased risk for infection and
               generally have poorer responses to vaccines. In this study, we
               examined antibody responses after complete COVID-19 vaccination
               in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, most of whom were
               receiving treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real world study of
               consecutive patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell
               dyscrasias (PCD) were evaluated after complete vaccination with
               either the 2-shot mRNA vaccines from BioNTech and Moderna or the
               1-shot adenoviral vector vaccine from Johnson \& Johnson (J\&J).
               Patients received vaccines 1-4 months before antibody testing
               without controlling for the type of vaccine or the timing of
               drug therapy. Patients with a clinical history or antibody
               evidence of prior infection were excluded. Antinucleocapsid and
               quantitative anti-spike antibody levels were measured with the
               Roche Elecys assay. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of patients had
               detectable antibody responses. Multivariate analysis showed that
               higher age, ongoing anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy and
               the J\&J vaccine negatively affected quantitative response. A
               small number of ineffectively vaccinated patients receiving IVIG
               subsequently had detectable nucleocapsid and spike antibodies
               confirming the presence of the latter in currently administered
               IVIG. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all PCD had detectable anti-spike
               antibodies after vaccination but age, anti-CD38 monoclonal
               antibody therapy, and the single-shot J\&J vaccine negatively
               affected responses. In patients who received the J\&J vaccine,
               second doses or heterologous mRNA vaccines should be tested.
               Quantitative antibody testing might make future management more
               rational, particularly in patients with poor responses.",

               COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalisation and COVID-19-related death.
               Data were obtained from the Information System for Research in

               without a prior COVID-19 diagnosis) and COVID-19-related death

               which 260 667 (5.6\%) had a history of cancer. A total of 98 951
               individuals (5.5\% with cancer) were diagnosed, and 6355 (16.4\%
               with cancer) were directly hospitalised with COVID-19. Of those

               it may be expected that low-toxicity natural compounds, such as
               Kampo formulas, will have a preventive effect on COVID-19.
               Although the biological properties and safety of the
               representative Kampo compounds, hochuekkito (HET) and kakkonto
               (KKT), have been confirmed in various animal model experiments,

               effects on various infectious diseases without significant
               toxicity, it is unclear whether HET and KKT are safe and
               effective for COVID-19 prevention. The study population included
               healthcare workers (HCWs), as they are at a higher risk of
               infection than the other populations. We retrospectively
               investigated the immunological and preventive effects of HET and
               KTT against COVID-19. We included 27 HCWs (aged 21-72 years, F:M
               = 18:9) from hospitals and clinics of the Hokuriku-Tokai region.
               The HCWs received HET and KKT for general fatigue and myalgia
               during this period for 28 days. We obtained patient clinical
               data from electronic medical records. We analyzed the changes in
               immunomodulation before and after the administration of the
               formulas from residual specimens based on the expression of
               relevant surface markers. The specimens were also tested for the
               presence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2. The following side effects were reported:
               abdominal discomfort in five patients, diarrhea in two, and
               loose or soft stool in three. All 27 HCWs tested negative for
               COVID-19 antibodies. HET and KKT administration significantly
               increased the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes
               expressing the activating receptors NKp46, NKp30, and
               suppressing receptor NKG2A. There was also a significant
               increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes
               expressing the receptors TLR4, OX40, 4-1BB, GITR, PD-1, and
               ICOS. These data indicate that HET and KKT can enhance and
               modulate NK activity in circulating human immune cells. The
               immunomodulatory effects, such as activation and regulation of T
               cells, are consistent with a putative improvement in infectious
               immunosurveillance. An increase in the number of T cells and
               CD4/CD8-positive cells indicates an enhanced ability to protect
               against infection. HET and KKT may prevent the onset or
               worsening of COVID-19 through their immunomodulatory effects.",

               patients, cancer-related thromboembolism is another lethal

               vaccination 12 days prior. Ischemic stroke and VITT were also

               cancer patients should be carefully managed. Further studies of

               95\% confidence intervals [CI] 9.38-11.03) compared to
               respondents with less fear (7.55; 95\% CI 6.75-8.36).
               Additionally, 47\% reported delaying care. Respondents with more
               fear of COVID-19 had higher percentages of delayed care than
               those with less (56; 95\% CI 39\%-72\% vs. 44\%; 95\% CI
               28\%-61\%). These relationships persisted throughout the
               pandemic. For respondents with a COVID-19 diagnosis in their
               household (n = 116), distress scores were similar despite higher
               delays in care (58\% vs. 27\%) than those without COVID-19.
               CONCLUSIONS: Fear of COVID-19 is linked to psychological
               distress and delays in care among patients with cancer.
               Furthermore, those who are personally impacted see exacerbated
               cancer care delays. Timely psychosocial support and health care
               coordination are critical to meet increased care needs of
               patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

               matched controls. Data on patients with hematological neoplasms
               after two vaccine doses were extracted and matched 1:1 with
               vaccinated controls. Subpopulation analyses focused on patients
               receiving therapy for the hematological neoplasm, patients
               without treatment who are only followed, and recipients of
               specific treatments. The analysis focused on covid-19 outcomes
               from day 7 through 43 following the second vaccine dose:
               Documented covid-19 infection by PCR; Symptomatic infection;
               Hospitalizations; Severe covid-19 disease and covid-19-related
               death. Of a population of 4.7 million insured people, 32,516
               patients with hematological neoplasms were identified, of whom
               5,017 were receiving therapy for an active disease. Vaccinated
               patients with hematological neoplasms, compared with vaccinated
               matched controls, had an increased risk of documented infections
               (RR 1.60, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.37), symptomatic
               covid-19 (RR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.05-2.85), covid-19 related
               hospitalizations (RR 3.13, 95\% CI 1.68-7.08), severe covid-19
               (RR 2.27, 95\% CI 1.18-5.19) and covid-19 related death (RR
               1.66, 95\% CI 0.72-4.47). Limiting the analysis to patients on
               hematological treatments showed a higher increased risk. This
               analysis shows that vaccinated patients with hematological
               neoplasms, in particular patients on treatment, suffer from
               covid-19 outcomes more than vaccinated individuals with intact
               immune system. Ways to enhance covid-19 immunity in this patient

               curable have complex needs, often managing health at home,
               supported by those close to them. Challenges are likely to be
               exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk-reducing
               measures introduced in response. The impact of COVID-19 on those
               living with incurable, life-threatening conditions is little
               understood. AIM: To investigate the experiences and identify the
               impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for people living with treatable
               not curable cancer and their informal carers. DESIGN:
               Qualitative semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with
               21 patients living with cancer that is treatable but not curable
               and 14 carers. SETTING/ PARTICIPANTS: Participants were part of
               a larger longitudinal qualitative study (ENABLE) on supported
               self-management for people living with cancer that is treatable
               but not curable. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic magnified
               uncertainty and anxiety and led to loss of opportunities to do
               things important to patients in the limited time they have left
               to live. Lack of face-to-face contact with loved ones had a
               significant impact on patients' and carers' emotional wellbeing.
               Carers experienced increased responsibilities but less access to
               formal and informal support and respite. While changes to
               treatment led to some concern about longer-term impact on
               health, most patients felt well-supported by healthcare teams.
               CONCLUSION: The study provides rich insights into the nature of
               challenges, uncertainty and lost opportunities resulting from
               the COVID-19 pandemic for patients and carers living with cancer
               that is treatable but not curable, which has wider resonance for

               therapeutic efficacy, potential adverse effects, susceptibility
               to COVID-19, and potential effects on efficacy of vaccination
               against SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed,
               Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and guideline databases.
               REVIEW METHODS: Guideline search strategies, supplemented by
               database searches on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL),
               idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy), sinonasal
               polyposis, laryngotracheal disorders, head and neck oncology,
               and pediatric otolaryngology, prioritizing systematic reviews,
               randomized controlled trials, and COVID-19-specific findings.
               CONCLUSIONS: Systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) reduce long-term
               morbidity in individuals with SSNHL and Bell's palsy, reduce
               acute laryngotracheal edema, and have benefit in perioperative
               management for some procedures. Topical or locally injected
               corticosteroids are preferable for most other otolaryngologic
               indications. SCSs have not shown long-term benefit for sinonasal
               disorders. SCSs are not a contraindication to vaccination with
               COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug
               Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
               noted that these vaccines are safe for immunocompromised
               patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: SCS use for SSNHL, Bell's
               palsy, laryngotracheal edema, and perioperative care should
               follow prepandemic standards. Local or topical corticosteroids
               are preferable for most other otolaryngologic indications.
               Whether SCSs attenuate response to vaccination against COVID-19
               or increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown.
               Immunosuppression may lower vaccine efficacy, so
               immunocompromised patients should adhere to recommended
               infection control practices. COVID-19 vaccination with
               Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson \& Johnson vaccines is safe
               for immunocompromised patients.",

               pandemic management measures on cancer services at the National
               Cancer Institute (NCI) of Lithuania. We assessed the time period
               from 1 February 2020 to 31 December 2020 and compared it to the
               same period of 2019. Data for our analysis were extracted from
               the NCI Hospital Information System (HIS) and the National
               Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). Contingency table analysis and
               ANOVA were performed. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected
               the cancer services provided by NCI. Reductions in diagnostic
               radiology (-16\%) and endoscopy (-29\%) procedures were
               accompanied by a decreased number of patients with ongoing
               medical (-30\%), radiation (-6\%) or surgical (-10\%) treatment.
               The changes in the number of newly diagnosed cancer patients
               were dependent on tumor type and disease stage, showing a rise
               in advanced disease at diagnosis already during the early period
               of the first lockdown. The extent of out-patient consultations
               (-14\%) and disease follow-up visits (-16\%) was also affected
               by the pandemic, and only referrals to psychological/psychiatric
               counselling were increased. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic
               had an impact on the structure of cancer services by fostering
               the application of modified systemic anticancer therapy or
               hypofractionated radiotherapy. The most dramatic drop occurred
               in the number of patients participating in cancer prevention
               programs; the loss was 25\% for colon cancer and 62\% for breast
               cancer screening. Marked restriction in access to preventive
               cancer screening and overall reduction of the whole spectrum of

               Retrospective observational study including cancer patients
               submitted to FDG PET/CT staging from June 1 to October 31, 2020,
               and June 1 to October 31, 2019, respectively. Data regarding
               primary tumour, nodal (N) status and number of involved nodal
               stations, and presence and number of distant metastases (M) were
               collected. Each scan was classified in limited vs advanced

               tumour type. Bi-weekly frequencies of the observed events were
               analysed. RESULTS: Six hundred eleven patients were included
               (240 in 2019 vs 371 in 2020, respectively). A significant
               increase of advanced disease patients (rate 1.56, P < 0.001), N
               + or M + patients (rate 1.84 and 2.09, respectively, P < 0.001),

               (rate 2.01 and 2.06, respectively, P < 0.001) were found in 2020
               compared with data of 2019. Analysis by tumour type showed a
               significant increase of advanced disease in lymphoma and lung
               cancer in 2020 compared with 2019 (P < 0.001). In addition, a
               significant increase of nodal involvement was found in lung,
               gastro-intestinal, and breast cancers, as well as in lymphoma
               patients (P < 0.02). A significant increase of distant

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It remains unclear if patients with allergic
               rhinitis (AR) and/or asthma are susceptible to corona virus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, severity, and mortality.
               OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of AR and/or asthma in
               COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality, and assess whether
               long-term AR and/or asthma medications affected the outcomes of
               COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic and clinical data of 70,557 adult
               participants completed SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 16 and
               December 31, 2020, in the UK Biobank were analyzed. The rates of
               COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and mortality in relation
               to pre-existing AR and/or asthma were assessed based on adjusted
               generalized linear models. We further analyzed the impact of
               long-term AR and/or asthma medications on the risk of COVID-19
               hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Patients with AR of all
               ages had lower positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 tests (relative risk
               [RR]: 0.75, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.81, P < .001),
               with lower susceptibility in males (RR: 0.74, 95\% CI:
               0.65-0.85, P < .001) than females (RR: 0.8, 95\% CI: 0.72-0.9, P
               < .001). However, similar effects of asthma against COVID-19
               hospitalization were only major in participants aged <65 (RR:
               0.93, 95\% CI: 0.86-1, P = .044) instead of elderlies. In
               contrast, patients with asthma tested positively had higher risk
               of hospitalization (RR: 1.42, 95\% CI: 1.32-1.54, P < .001).
               Neither AR nor asthma had an impact on COVID-19 mortality. None
               of conventional medications for AR or asthma, for example,
               antihistamines, corticosteroids, or $\beta$2 adrenoceptor
               agonists, showed association with COVID-19 infection or
               severity. CONCLUSION: AR (all ages) and asthma (aged <65) act as
               protective factors against COVID-19 infection, whereas asthma
               increases risk for COVID-19 hospitalization. None of the
               long-term medications had a significant association with
               infection, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 among patients
               with AR and/or asthma.",

               hospital attendances and potential exposure of vulnerable
               patients to minimise the risk of COVID-19 infection. We describe
               the changes that took place in the management of patients with
               stage I-III lung cancer from April to October 2020. MATERIALS
               AND METHODS: Lung Radiotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic
               (COVID-RT Lung) is a prospective multicentre UK cohort study.
               The inclusion criteria were: patients with stage I-III lung
               cancer referred for and/or treated with radical radiotherapy
               between 2nd April and 2nd October 2020. Patients who had had a
               change in their management and those who continued with standard
               management were included. Data on demographics, COVID-19
               diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, radiotherapy and systemic
               treatment were collected and reported as counts and percentages.
               Patient characteristics associated with a change in treatment
               were analysed using multivariable binary logistic regression.
               RESULTS: In total, 1553 patients were included (median age 72
               years, 49\% female); 93 (12\%) had a change to their diagnostic
               investigation and 528 (34\%) had a change to their treatment
               from their centre's standard of care as a result of the COVID-19
               pandemic. Age $\geq$70 years, male gender and stage III disease
               were associated with a change in treatment on multivariable
               analysis. Patients who had their treatment changed had a median
               of 15 fractions of radiotherapy compared with a median of 20
               fractions in those who did not have their treatment changed. Low
               rates of COVID-19 infection were seen during or after
               radiotherapy, with only 21 patients (1.4\%) developing the
               disease. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes
               to patient treatment in line with national recommendations. The
               main change was an increase in hypofractionation. Further work

               of adult inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to Northern Health
               from March to September 2020. Data were extracted from
               electronic medical records. RESULTS: Key admission data was
               available for 182 patients (median age 67.0 years (interquartile
               range, 47.9-83.1; 51.1\% female). 56 (30.8\%) were from

               Comorbidities were present in 135 patients (74.2\%). 63.2\% of

               in-hospital clinical deterioration was significantly associated
               with older age (p<0.001), history of diabetes (p=0.038), lower

               The accuracy of the 4C Deterioration model was moderate, with an
               area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.68-0.90) compared

               underlying the occurrence of cavitation and pneumothorax is not
               well understood. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is
               an infectious condition characterized primarily by pneumonia, is
               sometimes accompanied by pulmonary cavitation. Patients with
               COVID-19 who present with pulmonary cavitation may have a poor
               prognosis. In the present case, a patient with papillary thyroid
               carcinoma presented with multiple pulmonary metastatic tumors
               that were treated with lenvatinib. After 9 weeks from treatment
               initiation, he experienced fever and presented with pulmonary
               consolidation and ground-glass opacity (GGO). Pneumonia improved
               after the withdrawal of lenvatinib. After 21 weeks from
               treatment initiation, he developed fever again and the clinical
               tests led to the diagnosis of COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT)
               showed new GGO in both sides of the lung. Therefore, the patient
               was diagnosed with moderate COVID-19. He was treated with
               dexamethasone plus remdesivir, and GGO due to COVID-19
               disappeared. However, the previous pulmonary shadow associated
               with lenvatinib became a cavitary lesion. The initial CT
               findings of COVID-19 and pneumonia associated with lenvatinib
               are similar. Thus, both conditions must be considered for a

               telehealth may reduce travel/waiting times and costs for many

               care disparities in historically underserved populations,
               manifesting as differences in overall care participation, and in
               differential video versus phone use for telehealth. METHODS: We
               reviewed visits by cancer survivors between January and December
               2020 at a designated cancer center in Minnesota. We used
               descriptive statistics, data visualization, and generalized
               estimating equation logistic regression models to compare visit
               modalities and trends over time by age, urban/rural status, and
               race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 159,301 visits, including 33,242
               telehealth visits, older and rural-dwelling individuals were
               underrepresented in telehealth compared with in-person care.
               Non-Hispanic White individuals, those aged 18-69 years, and
               urban residents used video for > 50\% of their telehealth
               visits. In contrast, those aged $\geq$ 70 years, rural
               residents, and most patient groups of color used video for only
               33-43\% of their telehealth visits. Video use increased with
               time for everyone, but relative differences in telehealth
               modalities persisted. Visits of Black/African American patients
               temporarily fell in spring/summer 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               findings underscore reduced uptake of telehealth, especially
               video, among potentially vulnerable patient populations. Future
               research should evaluate reasons for differential telehealth

               immunosuppressant (IS) on liver transplant (LT) recipients with
               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unexplored. Our
               specific aim was to approximate the prognosis of LT recipients
               with COVID-19 on the standard maintenance IS. Method: We
               searched separate databases for the qualified studies in between
               December 2019 and June 25, 2021. Ultimately, a meta-analysis was
               carried out using a fixed-effect or random-effect model based on
               the heterogeneity. Results: In a total of eight studies and 509
               LT recipients with COVID-19, the pooled rates of severity and
               mortality during all the combined immunosuppressive therapies
               were 22.4 and 19.5\%, respectively. Our study sufficiently
               showed that an immunosuppressive therapy in LT recipients with
               COVID-19 was significantly associated with a non-severe COVID-19
               [odds ratio (OR): 11.49, 95\% CI: 4.17-31.65; p 60, the duration
               of LT to the diagnosis of COVID-19, primary disease for LT, and
               obesity were not significantly associated with the severity and
               mortality in LT recipients with COVID-19 under an
               immunosuppressive therapy. However, our pooled analysis found
               that LT recipients with COVID-19 and without comorbidities have
               a less severe disease and low mortality rate compared to those
               with both COVID-19 and comorbidities. Conclusions: In
               conclusion, LT recipients with COVID-19 undergoing
               immunosuppressive therapies are not significantly associated
               with the severity and mortality. Therefore, taking the risk of
               organ rejection into a key consideration, a complete withdrawal
               of the IS may not be wise. However, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
               might be discontinued or replaced from an immunosuppressive
               regimen with the CNIs- or mTORis-based immunosuppressive therapy

               reported in patients with COVID-19, even without prior
               predisposition to thrombosis. Cancer patients are already
               predisposed to a hypercoagulable state. This study was designed
               to assess the TE incidence in COVID-19+ patients with active
               cancer and its impact on survival. METHODS: Data from cancer
               patients with documented COVID-19 during the dates March
               15th-April 10th, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Active
               cancer was defined as disease treated within the past year.
               Diagnosis and evaluation of thrombosis were done at the
               clinicians' discretion. All imaging studies' reports within 30
               days of the COVID-19 positive test were reviewed for
               identification of new arterial and/or venous TE. Patients were
               followed for 30 days from the date of COVID-19+ test for
               development of TE, hospital length of stay (LOS), and mortality.
               RESULTS: Of 90 patients, 11 (12.2\%) were found to have 13 new
               TE within 30 days of COVID-19+ test: 8 (8.9\%) arterial and 5
               (5.6\%) venous. Arterial TE was primarily new strokes and/or
               microvascular cerebral disease (7) with 1 splenic infarct.
               Venous TE was superficial (1) and deep (3) venous thromboses
               with 1 pulmonary embolism. Peak D-dimer (DD) values were
               numerically higher in the TE group versus those with no TE,
               median peak DD, 7.7 versus 3.2 $\mu$g/mL, p = 0.25. Kidney
               disease was more frequent among patients with TE (72.7\%) versus
               those without TE (31.6\%), p = 0.02. Prophylactic or therapeutic
               anticoagulation (AC) in the inpatient setting was more common
               among those without TE, any AC, TE versus no TE, 9.1\% versus
               79.0\%, p < 0.0001. Only 1 patient on enoxaparin prophylaxis
               developed TE. Mortality was higher in the TE group than in those
               without TE (hazard ratio: 2.6; 95\% CI [1.2-5.6], p = 0.009).
               Cancer type, presence of metastases, administration of prior
               chemotherapy, patient setting (inpatient, intensive care unit,
               outpatient, emergency department visit), LOS, and ventilation
               did not correlate with increased incidence of TE. CONCLUSION:
               Cancer patients with COVID-19 have high overall TE rates with a
               significant incidence of arterial events. TE was associated with
               worse survival outcomes.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Due to the first COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent
               restrictions, standard practice for gynecological cancer quickly
               evolved to include additional digital consultations. Women with
               gynecological cancer have a high need for information and
               experience a high symptom burden. We aimed to explore the
               experiences and perspectives of the rapid implementation of
               digital consultations during COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted
               individual telephone interviews with patients with gynecological
               cancer 1-4 days after a telephone or video consultation during
               the COVID-19 outbreak in April and May 2020. We applied Braun
               and Clarke's thematic analysis to analyze the qualitative data.
               RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with ovarian (50\%), cervical
               (35\%), vulvar (12\%), and vaginal cancer (3\%) participated in
               the study. The patients experienced that, combined, cancer and
               COVID-19 restrictions made their situation twice as challenging.
               In general, the patients valued face-to-face consultations,
               recommending that they were ideal for the initial appointment to
               build trust. Overall, there was a willingness to participate in
               digital consultations because of the restrictions, but the
               results also showed varying degrees of openness and that
               individual solutions were favored. CONCLUSION: The findings of
               this study show that digital consultations were an accepted
               alternative during COVID-19. Even though this temporary solution
               was deemed to be beneficial for practical reasons, patients also
               experienced digital consultations to be impersonal. A key
               message is that face-to-face encounters create the foundation to
               establish a trusting relationship from where a valuable dialogue
               arises. Digital consultations should therefore be implemented
               with caution since no one-size-fits-all model is recommended.
               Among patients with gynecological cancer, however, digital
               technologies represent a promising and flexible method depending
               on the purpose of consultations, patient preferences, and needs.",

               had a serious impact on health all over the world. Cancer
               patient, whose immunity is often compromised, faces a huge
               challenge. Currently, some COVID-19 vaccines are being developed
               and applied on general population; however, whether cancer
               patients should take COVID-19 vaccine remains unknown. Our study
               aimed to explore the knowledge, attitude, acceptance, and
               predictors of intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among
               cancer patients in Eastern China. METHODS: A cross-sectional
               study was conducted in Eastern China from June 17th to September
               3rd, 2021. Patients were selected using a convenience sampling
               method. A self-report questionnaire was developed to assess
               knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine, attitude towards the
               vaccine and acceptance of the vaccine; following a review of
               similar studies previously published in the scientific
               literature, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used
               to determine the predictors associated with COVID-19 vaccine
               acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 2158 cancer patients were
               enrolled in this study. The rate of vaccine hesitancy was
               24.05\% (519/2158); further, among the participants of vaccine
               acceptance, 767 had taken COVID-19 vaccine (35.54\%), and 872
               were willing to get vaccinated (40.01\%). A total of 24
               variables including demographic characteristics, clinical status
               of cancer, impact of COVID-19 pandemic on study participants,
               patients' knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine, and attitude
               towards the vaccine, had significant differences between the
               ``vaccine hesitancy'' population and ``vaccine acceptance''
               population. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated
               that parameters including alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] =
               1.849; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.375-2.488; P-reference

               severe impact, respectively; all P-Ref < 0.01 vs no impact),
               knowledge of how the vaccine was developed (OR = 1.616; 95\% CI:
               1.126-2.318; P-Ref = 0.009 vs unknown), believing in the safety
               of the vaccine (OR = 1.502; 95\% CI: 1.024-2.203; P-Ref = 0.038
               vs denying the safety of vaccine), willingness to pay for the
               vaccine (OR = 3.042; 95\% CI: 2.376-3.894; P-Ref < 0.001 vs
               unwilling), and willingness to recommend families and friends to

               vs do not recommend) were contributors to vaccine acceptance.
               While such as being retired (OR = 0.586; 95\% CI: 0.438-0.784;
               P-Ref < 0.001 vs unemployed), undergoing multiple therapies of
               cancer (OR = 0.408; 95\% CI: 0.221-0.753; P-Ref = 0.004 vs no
               ongoing treatment), and worrying that the vaccine might
               deteriorate the prognosis of cancer (OR = 0.393; 95\% CI:
               0.307-0.504; P-Ref < 0.001 vs might not) were contributors to

               estimates of the rates of vaccine acceptance and vaccine
               hesitancy among cancer patients in Eastern China. The intention
               to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was impacted by factors such as
               patient occupation, alcohol consumption, and some parts of
               knowledge about and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine. It is
               recommended to develop individualized vaccination plans that

               modus operandi of all fields of medicine, significantly
               impacting patients with oncological diseases and multiple
               comorbidities. Thus, in recent months, the establishment of
               melanoma management during the emergency has become a major area
               of interest. In addition to original articles, case reports and
               specific guidelines for the period have been developed. PURPOSE:
               This article aims to evaluate whether melanoma management has
               been changed by the outbreak of COVID-19, and if so, what the
               consequences are. We summarized the main issues concerning the
               screening of suspicious lesions, the diagnosis of primary
               melanoma, and the management of early-stage and advanced
               melanomas during the pandemic. Additionally, we report on the
               experience of our dermatological clinic in northern Italy.
               METHODS: We performed a literature review evaluating articles on
               melanomas and COVID-19 published in the last two years on
               PubMed, as well as considering publications by major healthcare
               organizations. Concerning oncological practice in our center, we
               collected data on surgical and therapeutic procedures in
               patients with a melanoma performed during the first months of
               the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: During the emergency period, the
               evaluation of suspicious skin lesions was ensured as much as
               possible. However, the reduced level of access to medical care
               led to a documented delay in the diagnosis of new melanomas.
               When detected, the management of early-stage and advanced
               melanomas was fully guaranteed, whereas the follow-up visits of
               disease-free patients have been postponed or replaced with a
               teleconsultation when possible.",

               severe COVID-19 remain at high risk of thromboembolic events
               despite anticoagulant administration, with adverse impact on
               in-hospital prognosis. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 4742
               patients with acute infectious respiratory disease (AIRD); 2579
               were diagnosed to have COVID-19 and treated with heparin,
               whereas 2163 had other causes of AIRD. We compared the incidence

               in the whole population and in a propensity score-matched
               subpopulation of 3036 patients (1518 in each group). RESULTS:
               271 thrombotic events occurred in the whole population: 121
               (4.7\%) in the COVID-19 group and 150 (6.9\%) in the no-COVID-19
               group (p < 0.001). No differences in the incidence of total (p =
               0.11), arterial (p = 0.26), and venous (p = 0.38) thrombosis
               were found between the two groups after adjustment for
               confounding clinical variables and in the propensity
               score-matched subpopulation. Likewise, there were no significant
               differences in bleeding rates between the two groups. Clinical
               predictors of arterial thrombosis included age (p = 0.006),
               diabetes mellitus (p = 0.034), peripheral artery disease (p <
               0.001), and previous stroke (p < 0.001), whereas history of
               solid cancer (p < 0.001) and previous deep vein thrombosis (p =
               0.007) were associated with higher incidence of venous
               thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19
               treated with heparin do not seem to show significant differences
               in the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events as well as

  abstract  = "Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had become a
               health care event endangering humans globally. It takes up a
               large number of healthcare resources. We studied the impact of
               COVID-19 on patients with ovarian cancer by comprehensively
               analyzing their admissions before and after the epidemic, and
               made reasonable suggestions to improve their current situation.
               Methods: We randomly divided the enrolled patients into three
               groups, PreCOVID-19 Group (PCG) (2019.8.20-2020.1.20), COVID-19
               Group (CG) (2020.1.21-2020.6.14), and Secondary Outbreak
               COVID-19 Group (SOCG) (2020.6.15-2020.10.10). One-way ANOVA and
               chi-square test were used for analysis. Results: The number of
               patients from other provinces decreased significantly (p <
               0.05). The total hospital stay during the epidemic was
               substantially more extended (p < 0.05). Before the epidemic, our
               department performed more open surgery while during the epidemic
               outbreak, we tended to choose laparoscopy (p < 0.01). We took a
               longer surgery time (P < 0.05). Patients had significantly less
               post-operative fever during the epidemic (p < 0.001).
               Conclusion: During the COVID-19 epidemic, no patient was
               infected with COVID-19, and no patient experienced severe

               full daily disinfection of the ward and insist that health care
               workers disinfect their hands after contact with patients; 3.
               Increase the use of minimally invasive procedures, including
               laparoscopy and robotics; 4. Disinfect the ward twice a day with
               UV light and sodium hypochlorite disinfectant; 5. Patients need

               with worse outcomes. However, the studies on cancer-related
               characteristics associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes have
               shown controversial results. The objective of the study was to
               evaluate cancer-related characteristics associated with invasive
               mechanical ventilation use or in-hospital mortality in patients
               with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We
               designed a cohort multicenter study including adults with active
               cancer admitted to ICU due to COVID-19. Seven cancer-related
               characteristics (cancer status, type of cancer, metastasis
               occurrence, recent chemotherapy, recent immunotherapy, lung
               tumor, and performance status) were introduced in a multilevel
               logistic regression model as first-level variables and hospital
               was introduced as second-level variable (random effect).
               Confounders were identified using directed acyclic graphs.
               Results: We included 274 patients. Required to undergo invasive
               mechanical ventilation were 176 patients (64.2\%) and none of
               the cancer-related characteristics were associated with
               mechanical ventilation use. Approximately 155 patients died in
               hospital (56.6\%) and poor performance status, measured with the
               Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score was associated
               with increased in-hospital mortality, with odds ratio = 3.54
               (1.60-7.88, 95\% CI) for ECOG =2 and odds ratio = 3.40
               (1.60-7.22, 95\% CI) for ECOG = 3 to 4. Cancer status, cancer
               type, metastatic tumor, lung cancer, and recent chemotherapy or
               immunotherapy were not associated with in-hospital mortality.
               Conclusions: In patients with active cancer and COVID-19
               admitted to ICU, poor performance status was associated with
               in-hospital mortality but not with mechanical ventilation use.

               levels and the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients
               infected with SARS-CoV-2. Serum C5a levels were determined in 32
               hospitalized and 17 non-hospitalized patients from Clinica
               Universidad de Navarra. One hundred and eighty eight serial
               samples were collected during the hospitalization stay and up to
               three months during the follow-up. Median C5a levels were 27.71
               ng/ml (25th to 75th percentile: 19.35-34.96) for samples
               collected during hospitalization, versus 16.76 ng/ml
               (12.90-25.08) for samples collected during the follow-up
               (p<0.001). There was a negative correlation between serum C5a
               levels and the number of days from symptom onset (p<0.001). C5a
               levels also correlated with a previously validated clinical risk
               score (p<0.001), and was associated with the severity of the
               disease (p<0.001). An overall reduction of C5a levels was
               observed after hospital discharge. However, elevated C5a levels

  abstract  = "Background: Cancer patients are classified as being at high risk
               of contracting COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death
               and were recommended to have early access to the limited
               COVID-19 vaccine. However, there are limited studies on the
               knowledge and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among cancer
               patients. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the
               awareness, readiness, and associated factors among cancer
               patients. Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional study was
               conducted on 422 cancer patients from May to August, 2021. A
               structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to
               collect primary data. A systematic random sampling technique was
               used to select study participants. Descriptive statistics and
               binary logistic regression followed by multivariable analysis
               were performed to investigate the independent association of
               factors with the outcome variable. Finally, statistical
               significance was declared at P <0.05 using AOR and 95\% CI.
               Results: From the 422 cancer patients who participated, 77
               (18.2\%) had a history of COVID-19 infection, and 224 (55\%)
               believe that the cancer disease will not make them more
               vulnerable to be infected by COVID-19. Accordingly, younger age
               (18-30 years) (AOR = 2.73: 95\% CI: 0.18, 4.51), female (AOR =
               6.4: 95\% CI: 0.7, 13.8), having information about COVID-19
               vaccine (AOR = 6.9: 95\% CI: 3.1, 15.2), COVID-19 infection
               history (AOR = 6.0: 95\% CI: 2.5, 11.8), duration since cancer
               diagnosis ($\geq$10 years) (AOR= 6.2: 95\% CI: 2.6, 14.7), and

               = 3.05: 95\% CI: 1.03, 4.05) were the independent predictors of
               the likelihood of receiving COVID-19 vaccine among cancer
               patients. Conclusion: This study has found significant cancer
               patients with poor knowledge about the vaccine, and the
               percentage of both the first and second round of COVID-19
               vaccination was small. Therefore, information communication with
               cancer patients and oncologists about the COVID-19 vaccine may
               help to decrease vaccine hesitancy.",

              complications and mortality than the rest of the population.
              Breast cancer patients seem to have better prognosis when
              infected by SARS-CoV-2 than other cancer patients. Methods: We
              report a subanalysis of the OnCovid study providing more detailed
              information in the breast cancer population. Results: We included
              495 breast cancer patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mean age
              was 62.6 years; 31.5\% presented more than one comorbidity. The
              most frequent breast cancer subtype was luminal-like (n = 245,
              49.5\%) and 177 (35.8\%) had metastatic disease. A total of 332
              (67.1\%) patients were receiving active treatment, with radical
              intent in 232 (47.6\%) of them. Hospitalization rate was 58.2\%
              and all-cause mortality rate was 20.3\%. One hundred twenty-nine
              (26.1\%) patients developed one COVID-19 complication, being
              acute respiratory failure the most common (n = 74, 15.0\%). In
              the multivariable analysis, age older than 70 years, presence of
              COVID-19 complications, and metastatic disease were factors
              correlated with worse outcomes, while ongoing anticancer therapy
              at time of COVID-19 diagnosis appeared to be a protective factor.
              No particular oncological treatment was related to higher risk of
              complications. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73
              (18.3\%) patients had some kind of modification on their
              oncologic treatment. At the first oncological reassessment
              (median time: 46.9 days $\pm$ 36.7), 255 (51.6\%) patients
              reported to be fully recovered from the infection. There were 39
              patients (7.9\%) with long-term SARS-CoV-2-related complications.
              Conclusion: In the context of COVID-19, our data confirm that
              breast cancer patients appear to have lower complications and
              mortality rate than expected in other cancer populations. Most
              breast cancer patients can be safely treated for their neoplasm
              during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Oncological treatment has no impact
              on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 complications, and, especially in the
              curative setting, the treatment should be modified as little as
              possible.",

               pathway, regulatory pathway and biosynthesis of secondary
               metabolites etc. We also identified potential metagenomic

               prospective cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with
               300 adult patients using a validated COVID-19 Phobia Scale
               (C19P-S) and related survey to determine the factors affecting
               vaccine acceptance between May-June 2021. Results: Regarding the
               COVID-19 vaccine willingness, 86.7\% accepted vaccination, 6.3\%
               were hesitant and 7\% refused vaccination. Patients that
               accepted vaccination had significantly higher C19P-S scores in
               general, and in psychological and psychosomatic subdivisions.
               Univariate analysis revealed that increased age, being retired,
               and being married were significantly associated with willingness
               to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusion: The majority of
               patients had high coronophobia levels which were associated with
               increased willingness for the COVID-19 vaccines. Minimizing
               negative attitudes towards vaccines will most likely be achieved

               the lack of clinical data on safety and efficacy of COVID-19
               vaccination in cancer patients cause uncertainty among the
               patients about whether to get vaccinated or not. Here, we
               evaluated attitude towards and effects of COVID-19 vaccination
               in patients with breast and gynecological cancer undergoing
               systemic cancer therapy. METHODS: Since March 15th, 2021, cancer
               patients who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines were
               routinely interviewed about immediate and late side effects.
               Clinical parameters such as current therapy, time interval
               between therapy administration and vaccination, and changes in
               the therapy schedule due to vaccination were documented. The
               collected data were analyzed de-identified as a part of routine
               quality assurance. RESULTS: By July 27th, 2021, 218 patients
               (74.3\% breast cancer patients) had received one of two COVID-19
               vaccine doses, and 112 patients had received both doses: 77.5\%
               received Conmirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer), 16.1\% Vaxzevria (Astra
               Zeneca) and 5.9\% COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. The COVID-19
               vaccines had an acceptable safety profile with self-limiting
               local and systemic adverse events, which rarely lasted >48 h
               post vaccination. Symptoms occurred predominantly after the
               second dose of the vaccine and less frequently in older patients
               >55 years. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were
               reported, and only limited effects of vaccination on the therapy
               schedule were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Breast and gynecologic
               cancer patients tolerate the COVID-19 vaccination while
               undergoing systemic cancer therapy without any additional side
               effects beyond those reported in the general population.",

               longitudinal follow-up. SETTING: Hospital Universitario
               Pr{\'\i}ncipe de Asturias (HUPA). PARTICIPANTS: 287 patients
               diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital from 24 March
               to 8 May 2020, followed until 31 August 2020. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURES: Profiles of immune response (IR) mediators were
               determined using the Luminex Multiplex technique in hospitalized
               patients within six days of admission by examining serum levels
               of 62 soluble molecules classified into the three groups:
               adaptive IR-related cytokines (n = 19), innate inflammatory
               IR-related cytokines (n = 27), and growth factors (n = 16).
               RESULTS: A statistically robust link with ICU admission and/or
               death was detected for increased serum levels of interleukin
               (IL)-6, IL-15, soluble (s) RAGE, IP10, MCP3, sIL1RII, IL-8, GCSF

               When severe COVID-19 progresses to ICU admission and/or death
               there is a marked increase in serum levels of several cytokines
               and chemokines, mainly related to the patient's inflammatory IR.

               evasion potential, the so-called variants of concern (VOC), is a
               major concern. We describe the early genomic epidemiology of
               SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated health care professionals
               (HCP). Our postvaccination COVID-19 symptoms-based surveillance
               program among HCPs in a 17-hospital network identified all
               vaccinated HCPs who tested positive for COVID-19 after routine
               screening or after self-reporting. From 1 January 2021 to 30
               April 2021, 23,687 HCPs received either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2
               mRNA vaccine. All available postvaccination SARS-CoV-2 samples
               and a random collection from nonvaccinated patients during the
               similar time frame were subjected to VOC screening and
               whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Sixty-two percent (23,697/37,500)
               of HCPs received at least one vaccine dose, with 60\% (22,458)
               fully vaccinated. We detected 138 (0.58\%, 138/23,697) COVID-19
               cases, 105 among partially vaccinated and 33 (0.15\%, 33/22,458)
               among fully vaccinated. Five partially vaccinated required
               hospitalization, four with supplemental oxygen. VOC screening
               from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38\%) harboring
               N501Y and 1 (6\%) with E484K polymorphisms; percentage of
               concurrent nonvaccinated samples was 37\% (523/1,404) and 20\%
               (284/1,394), respectively. There was an upward trend from
               January to April for E484K/Q (3\% to 26\%) and N501Y (1\% to
               49\%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and nonvaccinated
               individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not
               detect an increased frequency of any receptor-binding domain
               (RBD)/N-terminal domain (NTD) polymorphism between groups (P >
               0.05). Our results support robust protection by vaccination,
               particularly among recipients of both doses. Despite VOCs
               accounting for over 40\% of SARS-CoV-2 from fully vaccinated
               individuals, the genomic diversity appears to proportionally
               represent VOCs among nonvaccinated populations. IMPORTANCE A
               number of highly effective vaccines have been developed and
               deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence and
               epidemiological dominance of SARS-CoV-2 mutants with high
               transmission potential and immune evasion properties, the
               so-called variants of concern (VOC), continue to be a major
               concern. Whether these VOCs alter the efficacy of the
               administered vaccines is of great concern and a critical
               question to study. We describe the initial genomic epidemiology
               of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from partial/fully vaccinated health
               care professionals and probe specifically for VOC enrichment.
               Our findings support the high level of protection provided by
               full vaccination despite a steep increase in the prevalence of
               polymorphisms associated with increased transmission potential
               (N501Y) and immune evasion (E484K) in the nonvaccinated
               population. Thus, we do not find evidence of VOC enrichment
               among vaccinated groups. Overall, the genomic diversity of
               SARS-CoV-2 recovered postvaccination appears to proportionally
               represent the observed viral diversity within the community.",

              Sinai Health System shows that substantial numbers of COVID-19
              patients without prior heart disease develop cardiac dysfunction.
              How COVID-19 patients develop cardiac disease is not known. We
              integrated cell biological and physiological analyses of human
              cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem
              cells (hiPSCs) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of
              interleukins, with clinical findings related to laboratory values
              in COVID-19 patients, to identify plausible mechanisms of cardiac
              disease in COVID-19 patients. We infected hiPSC-derived
              cardiomyocytes, from healthy human subjects, with SARS-CoV-2 in
              the absence and presence of IL-6 and IL-1$\beta$. Infection
              resulted in increased numbers of multinucleated cells.
              Interleukin treatment and infection resulted in disorganization
              of myofibrils, extracellular release of troponin-I, and reduced
              and erratic beating. Infection resulted in decreased expression
              of mRNA encoding key proteins of the cardiomyocyte contractile
              apparatus. Although interleukins did not increase the extent of
              infection, they increased the contractile dysfunction associated
              with viral infection of cardiomyocytes resulting in cessation of
              beating. Clinical data from hospitalized patients from the Mount
              Sinai Health System show that a significant portion of COVID-19
              patients without prior history of heart disease, have elevated
              troponin and interleukin levels. A substantial subset of these
              patients showed reduced left ventricular function by
              echocardiography. Our laboratory observations, combined with the
              clinical data, indicate that direct effects on cardiomyocytes by
              interleukins and SARS-CoV-2 infection might underlie heart
              disease in COVID-19 patients. Importance SARS-CoV-2 infects
              multiple organs including the heart. Analyses of hospitalized
              patients show that a substantial number without prior indication
              of heart disease or comorbidities show significant injury to
              heart tissue assessed by increased levels of troponin in blood.
              We studied the cell biological and physiological effects of virus
              infection of healthy human iPSC cardiomyocytes in culture. Virus
              infection with interleukins disorganizes myofibrils, increases
              cell size and the numbers of multinucleated cells, suppresses the
              expression of proteins of the contractile apparatus. Viral
              infection of cardiomyocytes in culture triggers release of
              troponin similar to elevation in levels of COVID-19 patients with
              heart disease. Viral infection in the presence of interleukins
              slows down and desynchronizes the beating of cardiomyocytes in
              culture. The cell level physiological changes are similar to
              decreases in left ventricular ejection seen in imaging of
              patients' hearts. These observations suggest that direct injury
              to heart tissue by virus can be one underlying cause of heart
              disease in COVID-19.",

               patients (4.6\%) and major surgical complications were observed
               in 12 patients (3.3\%). None of preoperatively vaccinated
               patients experienced postoperative COVID-19 infection or the
               related major complications. Conclusion: Although prioritizing
               COVID-19 vaccination in preoperative cancer patients has been
               recommended to prevent postoperative fatalities, only a small
               proportion of our patients have been vaccinated. Preoperatively
               vaccinated patients show advantages in the prevention of
               postoperative COVID-19 infection and major surgery
               complications. The slow rollout and disparity in the vaccination
               progress for patients requiring a major cancer surgery need to
               be specifically addressed.",

               (August 2019-January 2020) versus during (March-Sept 2020) the
               COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MD Anderson
               Symptom Inventory-head and neck module was used to assess
               curative intent in H\&N cancer patients' symptoms during
               radiotherapy. RESULTS: There were 158 patients in the
               pre-pandemic cohort and 137 patients in the pandemic cohort.
               There was no significant difference in enteral feeding
               requirements between the cohorts (21\% versus 30\%, p = 0.07).
               Weight loss was higher during the pandemic (mean - 5.6\% versus
               6.8\%, p = 0.03). On multivariate analysis, treatment during the
               pandemic was associated with higher symptom scores for

               susceptible and at higher danger of COVID-19 and associated
               consequences as a result of their compromised immune systems,
               which makes them particularly sensitive. Because of a variety of
               circumstances, cancer patients' diagnosis, treatment, and
               aftercare are very complicated and time-consuming during an
               epidemic. In such circumstances, advances in artificial
               intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms (ML) offer the
               capacity to boost cancer sufferer diagnosis, therapy, and care
               via the use of cutting technologies. For example, using clinical
               and imaging data combined with machine learning methods, the
               researchers may be able to distinguish among lung alterations
               induced by corona virus and those produced by immunotherapy and
               radiation. During this epidemic, artificial intelligence (AI)
               may be utilized to guarantee that the appropriate individuals
               are recruited in cancer clinical trials more quickly and
               effectively than in the past, which was done in a conventional
               and complicated manner. In order to better care for cancer
               patients and find novel and more effective therapies, It is
               critical that we move beyond traditional research methods and
               use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to update
               our research (ML). Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
               learning (ML) are being utilised to help with several aspects of
               the COVID-19 epidemic, such as epidemiology, molecular research
               and medication development, medical diagnosis and treatment, and
               socioeconomics. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and
               machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19
               patients is also being investigated. The combination of
               artificial intelligence and machine learning in COVID-19 may
               help to identify positive patients more quickly. In order to
               understand the dynamics of an epidemic that is relevant to
               artificial intelligence, when used in different patient groups,
               AI-based algorithms can quickly detect CT scans with COVID-19
               linked pneumonia, as well as discriminate non-COVID connected
               pneumonia with high specificity and accuracy. It is possible to

               resources of health care professionals for more than 1 year. The
               risk of missed diagnoses has been discussed in the medical
               literature, mainly for common diseases such as cancer and
               cardiovascular events. However, rare diseases also need
               appropriate attention in times of a pandemic. CASE REPORT: We
               report a 34-year-old woman with fever, pinprick sensation in her
               chest and thoracic spine, and dizziness after receiving the
               first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination. The patient's
               condition worsened with abdominal pain, red urine, and
               hyponatremia, needing intensive care admission. Syndrome of
               inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) was
               diagnosed. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis were
               ruled out. Acute hepatic porphyria was finally diagnosed, and
               the patient recovered completely after treatment with hemin.
               CONCLUSION: Currently, the focus of physicians is on COVID-19
               and associated medical problems, such as vaccine side effects.
               However, it is important to be vigilant for other uncommon

               Investigation around modifiable contributors of vaccine
               hesitancy plays a pivotal role in the formulation of coping
               strategies. We aimed to evaluate the impact of vaccine
               misconception in patients with lung cancer or pulmonary
               ground-glass opacity (GGO). A web-based questionnaire was
               constructed based on a qualitative interview with 15 patients
               and reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Six Likert
               five-scale questions were used to generate a score of vaccine
               misconception (SoVM), which ranged from 0 to 24 points, with a
               higher score indicating a higher level of misconception. A total
               of 61.6\% (324/526) patients responded to our questionnaire. A
               higher proportion of low willingness patients (n = 173),
               compared to high willingness patients (n = 151), disagreed that
               cancer patients should be prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination
               (82.1\% vs. 50.3\%, p < .001) and perceived themselves to have
               contraindications (45.7\% vs. 15.9\%, p < .001). The mean SoVM
               was significantly lower in the high willingness group than the
               low willingness group (9.9 vs. 13.0, p < .001). Among the
               unvaccinated patients, the SoVM increased as the willingness to
               be vaccinated decreased (p < .0001). In multivariable logistic
               regression, patients with higher SoVM (OR 0.783, 95\% CI
               0.722-0.848), being female (OR 0.531, 95\% CI 0.307-0.918) or
               diagnosed with lung cancer (OR 0.481, 95\% CI 0.284-0.814) were

               pandemic, otolaryngology departments across the United Kingdom
               have adopted non-face-to-face clinics with consultations being
               carried out remotely, via telephone or video calls. By reducing
               footfall on hospital sites, the aim of this strategy was to
               limit direct contact and curb the spread of infection. This
               report outlines our experience of conducting a telephone triage
               clinic in the assessment of urgent suspected head and neck
               cancer referrals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
               METHODS: New patients who were referred on the urgent suspected
               head and neck cancer pathway were prospectively identified
               between 1 May 2020 and 31 August 2020. Patients were triaged
               remotely using telephone consultations. Risk stratification was
               performed using the 'Head and Neck Cancer Risk Calculator'
               (HaNC-RC v.2). RESULTS: Four-hundred and twelve patients were
               triaged remotely during the 4-month study period. Of these, 248
               patients were deemed 'low risk' (60.2\%), 78 were classed as
               'moderate risk' (18.9\%) and 86 were considered 'high risk'
               (20.9\%) according to the HaNC-RC v.2 risk score. Twenty-four
               patients who were assessed during the study period were
               diagnosed with head and neck cancer (5.82\%). CONCLUSION: The
               use of teleconsultation, supported by a validated, symptom-based
               risk calculator, has the potential to provide a viable and
               effective adjunct in the assessment and management of new

               Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Provider and patient
               satisfaction measured by customized surveys. RESULTS: One
               hundred eighty-four encounters with 169 unique patients were
               scheduled. Of these, 14 were new visits and 170 were follow-up
               visits. Eighteen encounters (9.8\%) were either no shows or
               rescheduled, making for 166 encounters with 155 unique patients.
               Patient and provider responses comprised the following: 94.8\%
               of patient responses reported ``quite a bit'' or ``very much''
               for the telemedicine visit being a good experience; 63.1\% of
               patient responses reported ``quite a bit'' or ``very much'' for
               interest in using telemedicine visits in the future; and 83.9\%
               of provider responses reported ``quite a bit'' or ``very much''
               for the patient's main problem being addressed by the visit.
               Providers were more likely to prefer an in-person visit for a
               new or worsening problem versus a stable/improving problem. The
               most common services provided were medication
               prescription/titration and education/counseling. The least
               common services provided were making of new diagnoses, ordering
               interventional procedures, and making referrals. CONCLUSION:
               Telemedicine visits were well received by both patients and
               providers in a cancer rehabilitation medicine clinic setting.
               However, in the case of a new or worsening problem, satisfaction
               declined. These data support that telemedicine visits should be
               considered essential as part of comprehensive cancer
               rehabilitation care, especially during a public health crisis.",

  abstract  = "Purpose of Review: The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 presented a
               multitude of challenges for physicians nationwide. Standard of
               care treatment was tailored to protect patients from virus
               exposure, while delivering safe and adequate care. This article
               reviews the steps taken to treat and protect breast cancer
               patients during the pandemic and reentry approaches to resume
               care. Recent Findings: Breast cancer experts rapidly convened to
               develop treatment guidelines during the pandemic. These
               recommendations encompass screening approach, prioritization of
               breast cancer patients, educational modifications, research and
               data considerations, and a re-entry treatment approach as the
               pandemic evolved. Without prior experience with a pandemic of
               this magnitude, these guidelines were based on expert knowledge
               and previously established data. Summary: This emergency forced
               physicians to operate in a more efficient and effective manner
               to deliver value-based patient care, and future evaluation of
               these adjustments will determine if overall patient outcomes

               the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
               tocilizumab (TCZ), an antagonist of the interleukine-6 receptor,
               has emerged as a promising therapeutic choice, especially for
               the severe form of the disease. Proper synthesis of the
               available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is needed to inform
               clinical practice. METHODS: A systematic review with a
               meta-analysis of RCTs investigating the efficacy of TCZ in
               COVID-19 patients was conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, and the
               Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register were searched up until 30 April
               2021. RESULTS: The database search yielded 2885 records; 11
               studies were considered eligible for full-text review, and nine
               met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 3358 patients composed the
               TCZ arm, and 3131 the comparator group. The main outcome was
               all-cause mortality at 28-30 days. Subgroup analyses according
               to trials' and patients' features were performed. A trial
               sequential analysis (TSA) was also carried out to minimize type
               I and type II errors. According to the fixed-effect model
               approach, TCZ was associated with a better survival odds ratio
               (OR) (0.84; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.75-0.94; I2: 24\%
               (low heterogeneity)). The result was consistent in the subgroup
               of severe disease (OR: 0.83; 95\% CI: 0.74-0.93; I2: 53\%
               (moderate heterogeneity)). However, the TSA illustrated that the
               required information size was not met unless the study that was
               the major source of heterogeneity was omitted. CONCLUSIONS: TCZ
               may represent an important weapon against severe COVID-19.

               reported in association with coronavirus disease 2019
               (COVID-19). However, only sporadic cases of mania or hypomania
               have been reported in patients with COVID-19. This study aimed
               to report clinical characteristics of 15 consecutive cases of
               COVID-19-associated mania or hypomania seen in three general
               hospitals in Qatar in the early months of the pandemic in 2020.
               METHODS: This study is a retrospective case-note review of 15
               cases of COVID-19-associated mania or hypomania (confirmed by
               polymerase chain reaction test), seen as inpatient consultations
               out of the first 100 consecutive patients managed by
               consultation-liaison psychiatric teams in Qatar between 2 March
               2020 and 7 July 2020. RESULTS: The mean age of the 15 patients
               was 40 years. Twelve patients had mania, and three had
               hypomania. Regarding the physical severity of COVID-19, 10
               patients were asymptomatic, two had upper respiratory tract
               symptoms alone and three had pneumonia. None of the patients
               were intubated. Potential risk factors for mania/hypomania
               included pandemic-related psychosocial stress before admission
               (n = 9), past history of mania/bipolar disorder (n = 6) or
               psychosis (n = 2), raised inflammatory markers (n = 7) and
               steroid use (n = 3). None had a history of recent substance
               misuse. Other than one patient with advanced cancer, none had
               comorbidity regarded as likely to have caused mania or
               hypomania. Three patients had mild white matter ischaemic
               changes on brain imaging. Standard pharmacological treatment for
               mania (i.e. antipsychotic medication supplemented by prn
               benzodiazepines) was effective. Ten patients were discharged
               home from the COVID-19 facility where they presented, but five
               required transfer to Qatar's psychiatric hospital for further
               treatment of mania. CONCLUSION: The association of mania or
               hypomania with COVID-19 may be spurious (e.g. representing an
               initial presentation of bipolar disorder) or causal. The
               reported cases illustrate a range of potential aetiological
               mechanisms by which COVID-19 could cause mania or hypomania.
               Cohort studies are necessary to determine the incidence,
               aetiology and prognosis of COVID-19-associated mania/hypomania.",

               coordination of the Lung Cancer Group of the Chinese Thoracic
               Society, we performed an online questionnaire survey among
               experts in lung cancer and patients with NSCLC. Convenience
               sampling was adopted for questionnaire survey of experts, and
               random sampling was adopted for questionnaire survey of

               descriptive analysis of the data was performed. RESULTS: Within
               24 h from the distribution of questionnaires to the deadline, a
               total of 808 and 321 valid questionnaires from patients and
               experts were collected across China, respectively. There were
               83.81\% of the experts performed moderately and strongly
               anti-tumor therapy for patients with NSCLC during the COVID-19
               pandemic. 76.6\% of patients mainly receive online public
               welfare treatment, and the patient satisfaction rate reached up
               to 64.97\%. For driver gene-positive patients with advanced
               NSCLC and nonCOVID-19, 82.87\% of the experts recommended
               first-line simple targeted therapy, and 12.77\% of the experts
               recommended targeted therapy with oral anti-angiogenic drugs.
               For patients who were unable to return to the hospital for
               treatment and showed resistance to the TKI therapy, 92.21\% of
               the experts recommended oral anti-angiogenic drugs as the
               third-line home-based therapy and above. For patients with
               advanced NSCLC combined with COVID-19, 98.76\% and 95.95\% of
               the experts recommended discontinuation of chemotherapy and
               immunotherapy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, most
               Chinese patients with NSCLC were still able to receive timely

               >210 million people worldwide. An optimal therapeutic approach
               for COVID-19 remains uncertain, to date. Since the history of
               cancer was linked to higher mortality rates due to COVID-19, the
               establishment of a safe and effective vaccine coverage is
               crucial in these patients. However, patients with cancer (PsC)
               were mostly excluded from vaccine candidates' clinical trials.
               This systematic review aims to investigate the current available
               evidence about the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in PsC.
               PATIENTS AND METHODS: All prospective studies that evaluated the
               safety and efficacy of vaccines against severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included, with
               immunogenicity after the first and the second dose as the
               primary endpoint, when available. RESULTS: Vaccination against
               COVID-19 for PsC seems overall safe and immunogenic after
               well-conducted vaccination schedules. Yet the seroconversion
               rate remains lower, lagged or both compared to the general
               population. Patients with hematologic malignancies, especially
               those receiving B-cell-depleting agents in the past 12 months,
               are the most at risk of poor seroconversion. CONCLUSION: A
               tailored approach to vaccination may be proposed to PsC,
               especially on the basis of the type of malignancy and of the
               specific oncologic treatments received.",

               interruption time, disease progression type, and survival
               status. The methods employed in order to compensate for RT
               interruption were also described. Results: There were altogether
               129 cancer patients whose RT was interrupted. Nineteen (14.7\%)
               patients experienced a total interruption time of at most 7
               days; the interruption time was 8-14 days for 27 (20.9\%)
               patients, and 15 or more days for 47 (36.4\%) patients. The
               remaining 36 (27.9\%) patients did not come back to our hospital
               for further RT. We first describe our experience with
               re-immobilization and/or re-planning (n = 17) as well as dose
               compensation/adjustment. Of the 40 definitive radiotherapy
               patients, 37 had squamous cell carcinoma of nasopharyngeal,
               lung, or cervical origin. Most patients (85/93, 91.4\%) were
               followed up for more than one year. Among the 40 patients who
               received definitive radiotherapy, nine patients experienced
               disease progression and five patients died. Three of the seven
               (42.9\%) patients who did not finish radiotherapy after
               interruption died, as compared to only two of the 33 (6.1\%)
               patients who completed radiotherapy. EQD2 (equivalent dose in 2
               Gy fractions) at the time point of RT interruption was
               calculated. Five of the six patients (83.3\%) who received EQD2
               $\leq$10 Gy suffered from disease progression, compared with
               four of the 34 (11.8\%) patients who received EQD2 >10 Gy. For
               the seven definitive radiotherapy cases who did not finish
               radiotherapy, three received systemic anti-cancer treatments and
               three died (all of whom did not receive further systemic
               therapies). Conclusions: This study provides the longest
               follow-up for the outcomes of RT interruption during COVID-19
               pandemic to date. It cannot imply causation but implies that
               completing RT is important, along with the utility of having
               patients remain on systemic therapies if RT is to be
               interrupted.",

               explored the diversity and predictors of histopathological
               findings across the EAU GORRG priority groups using a large
               database of 1734 consecutive patients undergoing elective
               surgery for nonmetastatic renal masses between 2017 and 2020 at
               a referral institution. Overall, 940 (54.2\%), 358 (20.6\%), and
               436 (25.2\%) patients were classified as low-, intermediate-,
               and high-priority, respectively. The low-, intermediate-, and
               high-risk groups significantly differed regarding all primary
               histopathological outcomes: benign histology (21.6\% vs 15.9\%
               vs 6.4\%; p < 0.001); non-organ-confined disease (5.0\% vs

               of Urology designed a scheme to prioritize patients needing
               surgery for kidney cancer according to their tumor
               characteristics and symptoms. We used results from our hospital
               database to test the scheme and found that the priority
               classification can be used to predict cancer outcomes after
               surgery. This scheme may be useful in prioritizing kidney cancer

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Delivering care for immunocompromised, high-risk
               patients with cancer during a pandemic has proven challenging.
               Patients with cancer on chemotherapy have a high risk of
               mortality if contracted COVID-19. If a patient goes directly to
               the emergency room, multiple contact points with other
               individuals can lead to unnecessary exposures from any airborne
               virus, such as COVID-19. Our cancer center has implemented an
               isolated clinic with personal protective equipment and direct
               access to a COVID-19 rule-out floor to manage those with febrile
               neutropenia (FN). METHODS: We implemented an outpatient,
               isolated, extended-hour clinic with access to personal
               protective equipment, laboratories, and antibiotics for patients
               with FN as a pilot project from April 1 to December 31, 2020,
               with the aim to decrease emergency department (ED) visits for FN
               by 50\%. RESULTS: Since the implementation of our clinic, we
               have screened 74 unique patients during 102 visits, of which 76
               led to a discharge and 26 led to a direct admit, thus avoiding
               the ED. Thirty-nine of these visits were for patients with
               recent travel or a known COVID-19 exposure. Bringing these
               patients to our isolated clinic ensured safety of the
               approximately 200 patients undergoing active treatment in our
               infusion center daily. CONCLUSION: Implementing this clinic has
               thus far successfully decreased the social footprint of our
               highest-risk patients with cancer in the ED considerably. Our
               efforts and hopes of decreasing the possible exposure of our
               immunocompromised patients to COVID-19 as well as the
               unnecessary exposure of the infusion center patients and
               personnel have thus far been effective.",

               Previous studies have shown that gut microbiota is associated

               Blautia genus, Lactobacillus genus, and Ruminococcus genus of

               microbiota imbalance in colorectal cancer patients may lead to
               the variation of OTU. RESULTS: Based on the GMrepo database, the
               gut microbiota of 1374 patients with colorectal neoplasms and
               27,329 healthy people was analyzed to investigate the
               differences in the abundance of microbes between colorectal
               neoplasms patients and healthy people. Furthermore, We collected
               feces samples from 12 patients with colorectal cancer and 8
               healthy people in Xiangya hospital for metabolomic analysis to
               investigate the potential mechanisms. Our study showed that the
               abundance of Blautia and Ruminococcus was significantly

               the severity of COVID-19 by shaping the gut microbiota, but the
               BMI of patients does not. CONCLUSIONS: Our work draws an initial
               point that gut microbiota imbalance is a risk factor of COVID-19

               tissues by Diptera larvae. Ophthalmic involvement occurs in less
               than 5\% of cases. As the most uncommon type of involvement,
               orbital myiasis usually affects patients with poor personal
               hygiene, a low socioeconomic status, a history of surgery, and
               cancer. FINDINGS: In January 2020, an 89-year-old man presented
               to the Oculoplastic Department of Farabi Eye Hospital (Iran)
               with a history of left-side progressive orbital mass for six
               months. A large infiltrative mass of the left orbit with
               extension to the globe, periorbita, and adnexa was remarkable at
               the presentation, and its appearance suggested malignancy. Our
               findings persuaded us to perform exenteration and
               histopathological evaluation which were reported as
               ``undifferentiated carcinoma''. Regular follow-up visits were
               recommended. In June 2020, with a 3-month delay, the patient
               presented with the recurrence of the mass complicated with
               mobile alive larva. Examinations revealed numerous maggots
               crawling out of an ulcerative and foul-smelling lesion. He
               stated that fear of COVID-19 infection postponed his follow-up
               visit. The patient underwent immediate mechanical removal of
               larvae, followed by wide local excision of the mass. CONCLUSION:
               Patients with carcinoma of the adnexal tissues seem to be more
               prone to myiasis infestation even though it is an uncommon
               disease. Since COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic with no end in
               sight appropriate protocols should be implemented to prevent

               efficacy of ibrutinib for cGVHD, preliminary results of clinical
               trials have shown promising efficacy of ibrutinib or
               acalabrutinib for certain T cell malignancies, allergies and
               severe COVID-19. However, both BTK inhibitors have no or limited
               efficacy for refractory or recurrent solid tumors. These
               clinical data together with additional pending results from
               ongoing trials will provide valuable information to guide the
               design and improvement of future trials, including optimization
               of combination regimens and dosing sequences as well as better
               patient stratification and more efficient delivery strategies.
               Such information will further advance the precise implementation
               of BTK inhibitors into the clinical toolbox for the treatment of
               different human diseases.",

               problems worldwide. The psychopathological implications of
               COVID-19 in cancer patients have rarely been addressed.
               Considering the increased vulnerability of oncology patients,
               this issue needs to be addressed to improve the long-term mental
               health status of these patients. Methods: We conducted a
               prospective study in outpatients under active cancer treatment
               during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A
               semi-structured 24-question survey was designed to measure
               baseline sociodemographic, psychosocial and COVID-19 exposure
               characteristics. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was
               used to measure psychological symptoms. A descriptive and
               analytical univariate analysis of the variables studied was
               performed. We used the Z-score to compare different populations
               (experimental and historical control cohort). Results: 104
               patients were included, the majority of which were women
               (64.4\%), were above 65 years of age (57.7\%), had either lung
               and breast cancer (56.7\%), had advanced disease (64\%) and were
               undergoing chemotherapy (63.5\%). 51\% of them expressed greater
               fear of cancer than of COVID-19 infection or both. In relation
               to HADS, 52.8\% of emotional distress, 42.3\% of anxiety and
               58.6\% of depression rates were detected. The main factors
               related with higher rates of psychological symptomatology were
               history of previous psychotropic drug consumption and the
               adoption of additional infection prevention measures because
               they considered themselves at risk of severe COVID-19 infection
               (p = 0.008; p = 0.003 for emotional distress, p = 0.026; p =
               0.004 for anxiety, and p = 0.013; p = 0.008 for depression).
               Tumor type, stage, oncologic treatment or rescheduling of cancer
               treatments were not related to higher levels of psychological
               symptomatology. Comparison of our results with another
               population of similar characteristics was not significant (Z
               score = -1.88; p = 0.060). Conclusions: We detected high rates
               of emotional distress during the first wave of the COVID-19
               pandemic among cancer patients in active treatment (52.8\%).
               This was higher and clinically relevant than observed in a
               comparable population (42.5\%), although not significant. Cancer
               itself is the main factor of concern for cancer patients, above
               and beyond the emotional distress generated by COVID-19

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: From the early days of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic
               continues to change whole life all around the world. Oncological
               patients are the most affected populations since these days.
               Because of decreasing numbers in surgery and endoscopy, gastric
               cancer patients had difficulties in treatment and diagnoses.
               Therefore, the early and long-term results may be affected
               during the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to evaluate
               pandemia effects on gastric cancer surgery in a single center.
               PATIENTS-METHODS: Patients were categorized as the COVID group
               and the Pre-COVID group. Patients who received neoadjuvant
               chemotherapy were excluded from the study. In the COVID period,
               50 patients underwent gastric cancer surgery, while 64 were
               operated on in the pre-COVID period. Patients' demographics and
               clinical and pathological outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS:
               There was no statistically significant difference in both
               periods among patient characteristics such as age, gender, and
               body mass index. Pre-operative laboratory results were similar
               between two groups. Although there was no difference in
               operation types, an increase was detected in Clavien-Dindo grade
               3 and higher complications during the COVID period. During the
               pandemic, there was a significant difference in the pathological
               outcomes. Peritoneal cytology-positive patients were h{\i}gher
               in the COVID group. More lymphovascular invasions were also
               detected in the COVID period. Finally, it resulted stage
               differences between two groups. CONCLUSION: Because of
               COVID-19's heavy burden on healthcare system, delays in the
               diagnosis and treatment of oncological patients may occur.
               Therefore, this may be affected pathological and survival
               outcomes of cancer patients. Finally, further investigations are
               needed.",

               concurrent COVID-19 infection during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and
               prior to widespread vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
               retrospectively analyzed 255 adult patients with a history of
               cancer who presented to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
               (MSKCC) urgent care center (UCC) from March 1, 2020 to May 31,
               2020 with concurrent COVID-19 infection. We evaluated
               associations between patient characteristics and 30-day
               mortality from initial emergency department (ED) or urgent care
               center (UCC) visit and the absence of a severe event within 30
               days. External validation was performed on a retrospective data
               from 29 patients followed at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
               Center that presented to the local emergency department. A late
               cohort of 108 additional patients at MSKCC from June 1, 2020 to
               January 31, 2021 was utilized for further validation. RESULTS:
               In the MSKCC cohort, 30-day mortality and severe event rate was
               15\% and 32\% respectively. Using stepwise regression analysis,
               elevated BUN and glucose, anemia, and tachypnea were selected as
               the main predictors of 30-day mortality. Conversely, normal
               albumin, BUN, calcium, and glucose, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio
               <3, lack of (severe) hypoxia, lack of bradycardia or tachypnea,
               and negative imaging were selected as the main predictors of an
               uneventful course as defined as a Lack Of a Severe Event within
               Thirty Days (LOSETD). Utilizing this information, we devised a
               tool to predict 30-day mortality and LOSETD which achieved an
               area under the operating curve (AUC) of 79\% and 74\%
               respectively. Similar estimates of AUC were obtained in an
               external validation cohort. A late cohort at MSKCC was
               consistent with the prior, albeit with a lower AUC. CONCLUSION:
               We identified easily obtainable variables that predict 30-day
               mortality and the absence of a severe event for patients with a
               history of cancer and concurrent COVID-19. This has been
               translated into a bedside tool that the clinician may utilize to

               department or urgent care setting.",

               reactivating exhausted T cells. However, they could also trigger

               influence the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and subsequent
               mortality. Recent results from studies of ICIs treatment on
               incidence and mortality of COVID-19 are controversial. MATERIALS
               AND METHODS: We searched databases PubMed, Embase, ISI of
               Knowledge, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
               (CENTRAL), as well as pre-print databases (MedRxiv and BioRxiv)

               other antitumor treatments in cancer patients in the area of
               COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcome was the incidence of
               COVID-19. The secondary outcomes were mortality of COVID-19.
               RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with a total of 117,735 patients
               were selected. Compared with other antitumor treatments, prior
               exposure to ICIs had not an increased risk of incidence [Odds

               indicated that prior exposure to ICIs may reduce the incidence
               of COVID-19 in metastatic cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: There
               was no significant difference on incidence and mortality of
               COVID-19 between prior exposure to ICIs with other anti-tumor

              COVID-19 and have a poor prognosis after infection. Breast cancer
              is one of the most common cancers. Since vaccination is an
              effective measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we studied
              the vaccination rate among breast cancer survivors and analyzed
              their characteristics to provide evidence for boosting the
              vaccination rate. The researchers conducted a multicenter,
              cross-sectional study on 747 breast cancer survivors from six
              hospitals in Wuhan city between June 5, 2021, and June 12, 2021.
              The self-administrated questionnaires based on relevant studies
              were distributed. The researchers then compared differences in
              characteristics among vaccinated patients, hesitant patients, and
              non-vaccinated patients. Moreover, they performed univariable and
              multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify potential
              factors associated with vaccination hesitancy. The researchers
              assessed a total of 744 breast cancer survivors -94 cases in the
              vaccinated group, 103 in the planning group, 295 in the hesitancy
              group, and 252 in the refusal group. The vaccination rate was
              12.63\% (95\% CI 10.25-15.02\%) and 37.23\% (95\% CI
              27.48-47.82\%) patients reported adverse reactions. The
              vaccination hesitancy/refusal rate was 73.52\% (95\% CI
              70.19-76.66\%), which was independently associated with current
              endocrine or targeted therapy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95\% CI
              1.03-2.24), no notification from communities or units (OR = 2.46,
              95\% CI 1.69-3.59) and self-perceived feel (general vs. good, OR

              (46.07\%), the person who would most influence decisions of

               population at high risk for mortality, whose clinical
               characteristics are still unknown in the second SARS-CoV-2 wave.
               The aim of this retrospective study was to compare epidemiology
               and clinical presentation of C19-CP referring to the emergency
               department (ED) of our institution (San Luigi Gonzaga University
               Hospital, Orbassano, Turin, Italy), in a 3-week observation
               period of the first and second COVID-19 waves, starting from the
               introduction of the corresponding national lockdowns. METHODS:
               We retrieved ED admissions from March 9 to 29, 2020, for the
               first wave, and from October 24 to November 13, 2020, for the
               second wave. We collected clinical characteristics of
               consecutive patients with molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2
               infection. We also considered untested or SARS-CoV-2-negative
               cancer patients referring to the ED in the reference time
               frames. RESULTS: C19-CP in the second wave exceeded those in the
               first wave despite the nonsignificant difference (39 of 576 v 8
               of 163; P = .5). Compared with nononcological patients, C19-CP
               were older (median age 70 years [interquartile range 61-77] v 60
               years [interquartile range 45-73]; P = .02) and presented more
               often with $\geq$ 2 comorbidities (40.4\% v 24.3\%; P = .02).
               Compared with nononcological patients, in C19-CP, respiratory
               failure (29 of 47 v 321 of 692; P = .049) and hospitalization
               (37 of 47 v 363 of 692; P = .0004) were higher, with comparable
               frequencies across the waves. Five of 24 and 10 of 27
               hospitalized cancer patients in the first and second waves
               developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization.
               CONCLUSION: C19-CP were a vulnerable population, irrespective of
               the COVID-19 waves. This highlights the need to prioritize
               vaccinations in oncological patients to safeguard and guarantee
               optimal anticancer care.",

              patients during the peak period of the COVID-19 epidemic in
              China. METHODS: With thyroid cancer patients who had attended
              Peking Union Medical College Hospital included, we collected
              their demographic and clinical characteristics, COVID-19-related
              factors, and outcomes of 4 psychological scales (Insomnia
              Severity Index [ISI], Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire
              [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], and Impact of
              Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]) through an online questionnaire and
              used multiple linear regression to find independent risk factors
              for each psychological symptom. RESULTS: A total of 219 patients
              were included. Insomnia, anxiety, depression, and clinically
              relevant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were reported by
              69 (31.5\%), 87 (39.7\%), 74 (33.8\%), and 44 (20.1\%) patients,
              respectively. Based on multiple linear regression, being
              single/divorced/widowed, having a lower level of education,
              receiving resources of science lectures during the epidemic, and
              experiencing disruption of routine treatment or follow-up were
              associated with poorer psychological health among patients with
              thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of psychological symptoms
              and potential risk factors were found in thyroid cancer patients
              during the peak period of COVID-19 in China. Based on these
              findings, the psychological status of these patients should be a
              focus, and the psychological support systems need to be
              strengthened for the prevention of psychological crises during

               infected with SARS-CoV-2, but it is not known how exercise
               affects immune responses to the virus. A healthy man completed a
               graded cycling ergometer test prior to and after SARS-CoV-2
               infection, then again after receiving an adenovirus vector-based
               COVID-19 vaccine. Using whole blood SARS-CoV-2 peptide
               stimulation assays, IFN-$\gamma$ ELISPOT assays, flow cytometry,
               ex vivo viral-specific T-cell expansion assays and deep T-cell
               receptor (TCR) $\beta$ sequencing, we found that exercise
               robustly mobilized highly functional SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells
               to the blood compartment that recognized spike protein, membrane
               protein, nucleocapsid antigen and the B.1.1.7 $\alpha$-variant,
               and consisted mostly of CD3+/CD8+ T-cells and double-negative
               (CD4-/CD8-) CD3+ T-cells. The magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell
               mobilization with exercise was intensity dependent and robust
               when compared to T-cells recognizing other viruses (e.g. CMV,
               EBV, influenza). Vaccination enhanced the number of
               exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2 T-cells recognizing spike protein
               and the $\alpha$-variant only. Exercise-mobilized SARS-CoV-2
               specific T-cells proliferated more vigorously to ex vivo peptide
               stimulation and maintained broad TCR-$\beta$ diversity against
               SARS-CoV-2 antigens both before and after ex vivo expansion.
               Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transiently elevated
               during exercise after both infection and vaccination. Finally,
               infection was associated with an increased metabolic demand to
               defined exercise workloads, which was restored to pre-infection
               levels after vaccination. This case study provides impetus for
               larger studies to determine if these immune responses to
               exercise can facilitate viral clearance, ameliorate symptoms of
               long COVID syndrome, and/or restore functional exercise capacity

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented many challenges
              to colorectal cancer (CRC) care. Many organisations opted to
              perform CRC resections in 'cold' sites. Infrastructure in
              Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (NHCT) necessitated
              co-locating CRC care with 'hot' COVID streams but with additional
              precautions. This study aimed to evaluate that approach for a
              consecutive series of CRC cases, diagnosed before and during the
              COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A prospectively populated data set of
              CRC patients diagnosed between 1 April 2019 and 30 September 2020
              was used. Patients presenting before 1 April 2020 were considered
              'pre-COVID' and those presenting subsequently as 'COVID era'.
              RESULTS: Some 344 cases were diagnosed in the 12 months
              'pre-COVID' and 166 in the 6 months of the 'COVID era'. The
              median numbers of days from referral to diagnosis (21 vs 20,
              p=0.373) and operation (63 vs 61, p=0.208) were unchanged. The
              'COVID era' saw an increase in the proportion of radiological
              diagnoses (39.5\% vs 53.0\%, p=0.004) with an associated decrease
              in endoscopic diagnoses (56.7\% vs 45.8\%, p=0.021). Rates of
              inoperable (1.5\% vs 1.2\%, p=0.821), obstructing (11.0\% vs
              16.2\%, p=0.272) and perforated tumours (0.6\% vs 1.5\%, p=0.492)
              remained the same. One patient developed COVID-19
              perioperatively. Rates of laparoscopic operation (59.5\% vs
              61.8\%, p=0.751), anastomotic leak (6.4\% vs 5.9\%, p=0.891),
              re-operative surgery (10.4\% vs 4.4\%, p=0.138), primary stoma
              (40.5\% vs 32.4\%, p=0.244) and 90-day mortality (0.6\% vs 1.5\%,
              p=0.492) did not change. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate infection
              control measures, it may be safe to continue providing standard

               medical resources were limited, while a limited number of
               studies have concentrated on the influences of COVID-19 on the
               treatment of cancer patients. This survey aimed to explore the
               protective awareness about COVID-19, the incidence and factors
               influencing treatment delay, and expected treatment modality of
               cancer patients, so as to assist cancer patients. METHODS: A
               current prospective, online survey was conducted through the
               WeChat platform on cancer outpatients at the Department of
               Peking University Third Hospital in China from March 4 to April
               4, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients completed the survey
               after excluding 35 patients with an incomplete questionnaire.
               Note that 100\% of the patients wore masks and paid attention to
               hand hygiene during the hospital visits, 73.0\% of the patients
               had a strong desire to treat cancer, and 41.8\% experienced
               treatment delay. The rate of treatment delay among the patients
               treated in other departments was markedly higher than that in
               our department (64.7\% vs. 38.7\%, p = .042). The results of
               logistic regression analysis showed that the previous treatment
               department was independently correlated with treatment delay.
               Moreover, 51.8\% of the patients preferred to receive
               chemotherapy in the day ward, 54.6\% hoped to receive a strong
               contact with doctors, and 83.7\% would like to receive online
               therapeutic consultation. CONCLUSION: The rate of treatment
               delay was remarkable, which may be related to previous treatment
               departments. Promotion of ``active management of attending
               physician'' and ``telemedicine'' may be highly advantageous for
               cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

               suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2) admitted to a Spanish hospital between February 26
               and May 21, 2020. Direct medical costs from the perspective of
               the hospital were calculated. We analyzed diagnostic tests,
               drugs, medical and nursing care, and isolation ward and ICU
               stays for three cohorts: patients seen in the emergency room
               only, hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2,
               and patients who tested negative. RESULTS: The impact on the
               hospital's budget for the 3 months was calculated at
               €15,633,180, 97.4\% of which was related to health care and
               hospitalization. ICU stays accounted for 5.3\% of the total
               costs. The mean cost per patient was €10,744. The main costs
               were staffing costs (10,131 to 11,357 €/patient for physicians
               and 10,274 to 11,215 €/patient for nurses). Scenario analysis
               showed that the range of hospital expenditure was between
               €14,693,256 and €16,524,924. The median impact of the pandemic
               on the Spanish health budget in the sensitivity analysis using
               bootstrapped individual data was €9357 million (interquartile
               range [IQR], 9071 to 9689) for the conservative scenario
               (113,588 hospital admissions and 11,664 ICU admissions) and
               €10,385 million (IQR, 110,030 to 10,758) for the worst-case
               scenario (including suspected cases). CONCLUSION: The impact of
               COVID-19 on the Spanish public health budget (12.3\% of total
               public health expenditure) is greater than multiple sclerosis,

               of patients aged 65 years or older hospitalized for COVID-19.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. We included
               patients aged 65 years or older who were hospitalized for
               COVID-19 and dead o discharged between March 5 and 25, 2020. We
               used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods
               to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.
               RESULTS: 277 patients were included in this study. The bivariate
               analysis showed significant differences (p1.2mg/dL (OR: 3.08

               2020 due to concern of the spread of coronavirus. With these
               societal changes came a notable reduction in emergency
               department attendance. Our aim was to analyse emergency
               urological procedures performed during the COVID-19 era versus
               the previous year. METHODS: A retrospective review of theatre
               logbooks was undertaken comparing numbers of emergency
               urological procedures performed between 1 March 2020 and 31 May
               2020 (i.e. the COVID-19 era) with the corresponding 3-month
               period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 173 cases were analysed
               between the two time periods. Similar overall numbers of cases
               were performed in 2019 (n = 90) and 2020 (n = 83). In
               particular, similar patient case numbers are also noted in both
               scrotal explorations (13 vs 9) and ureteric stone surgeries (69
               vs 70). However, orchidectomies for testicular cancers were
               reduced by 63\% (3/8). On further analysis of the scrotal
               exploration group, only 3 were performed in the period after
               lockdown regulations were instated. CONCLUSION: Whilst patients
               with ureteric colic continue to present, those with acute testis
               pain requiring exploration attended less frequently, raising the
               possibility of undiagnosed testicular torsion in the community.",

               of the disease into critical phase, and reducing the levels of
               inflammatory markers related to SARS-Cov-2 pathogenesis. Through
               an open-label clinical trial, 60 severe cases were randomly
               divided into control and intervention groups. During a 7-day
               period, patients in the control group received antivirals, i.e.,
               remdesivir or favipiravir, while the intervention group was
               treated with 1000 mg of quercetin daily in addition to the
               antiviral drugs. According to the results, taking quercetin was
               significantly associated with partial earlier discharge and
               reduced serum levels of ALP, q-CRP, and LDH in the intervention
               group. Furthermore, although the values were in normal range,

               and effective in lowering the serum levels of ALP, q-CRP, and
               LDH as critical markers involved in COVID-19 severity. However,

               characteristics of a large series of hospitalized patients for
               COVID-19 in order to identify predisposing and/or protective
               factors of CI and the outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is an
               observational, retrospective study on patients hospitalized in
               two Italian centres (San Raffaele Hospital and Cremona Hospital)
               for COVID-19 and at least one high-sensitivity cardiac troponin
               (hs-cTnt) measurement during hospitalization. CI was defined if
               at least one hs-cTnt value was above the 99th percentile. The
               primary end-point was the occurrence of CI during
               hospitalization. We included 750 patients (median age 67, IQR
               56-77 years; 69\% males), of whom 46.9\% had history of
               hypertension, 14.7\% of chronic coronary disease and 22.3\% of
               chronic kidney disease (CKD). Abnormal troponin levels (median
               troponin 74, IQR 34-147 ng/l) were detected in 390 patients
               (52\%) during the hospitalization. At multivariable analysis
               age, CKD, cancer, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were
               independently associated with CI. Independent predictors of very
               high troponin levels were chronic kidney disease and CRP levels.
               Patients with CI showed higher rate of all-cause mortality
               (40.0\% vs. 9.1\%, p = 0.001) compared to those without CI.

               high prevalence of CI and its prognostic role in hospitalized
               patients with COVID-19, highlighting the leading role of

               assessing symptoms of viral respiratory tract infections across
               8 body systems. This study evaluated the measurement properties
               of FLU-PRO Plus in a study enrolling individuals with
               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Data from a
               prospective cohort study (EPICC) in US Military Health System
               beneficiaries evaluated for COVID-19 was utilized. Adults with
               symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2) infection with FLU-PRO Plus survey information
               within 1 week of symptom onset were included. Reliability of
               FLU-PRO Plus was estimated using intraclass correlation
               coefficient (ICC; 2 days' reproducibility). Known-groups
               validity was assessed using patient global assessment (PGA) of
               disease severity. Patient report of return to usual health was
               used to assess responsiveness (day 1-6/7). Results: Two hundred
               twenty-six SARS-CoV-2-positive participants were included in the
               analysis. Reliability among those who reported no change in
               their symptoms from one day to the next was high for most
               domains (ICC range, 0.68-0.94 for day 1 to day 2). Construct
               validity was demonstrated by moderate to high correlation
               between the PGA rating of disease severity and domain and total
               scores (eg, total scores correlation: 0.69 [influenza-like
               illness severity], 0.69 [interference in daily activities], and
               -0.58 [physical health]). In addition, FLU-PRO Plus demonstrated
               good known-groups validity, with increasing domain and total
               scores observed with increasing severity ratings. Conclusions:
               FLU-PRO Plus performs well in measuring signs and symptoms in
               SARS-CoV-2 infection with excellent construct validity,
               known-groups validity, and responsiveness to change.

               evaluated a non-probabilistic sample of women above 20 years
               old, carried out between August and September of 2020, through a
               snowball sampling using a Google Forms application. Results:
               From a total of 2495 women, more than 70\% have not been
               screened for cervical cancer (77.8\% of 2244 women aged for
               screening), and more than 80\% have not been screened for breast
               cancer (80.2\% from 1325 women aged for mammography) during the
               pandemic. Also, 55.2\% of the women did not undergo routine
               blood tests during the same period. The most frequent reasons
               for not performing screening and routine tests were: they were
               up to date; fear of contracting Covid-19; they decided to
               postpone it until after the end of the pandemic; they were
               unable to schedule the appointment at the healthcare center for
               whatever reason; and the healthcare center was only attending
               Covid-19 patients. Women with no comorbidities have performed
               significantly more mammograms and routine blood tests than women
               with comorbidities. In addition, women with comorbidities who
               were used to perform periodic medical follow-up have done it
               substantially more than women with no comorbidities during the
               pandemic. Conclusion: As observed, there was a significant
               decrease in women's access to the healthcare system during this
               pandemic. Many participants reported that they had not attended
               any screening tests, and some reasons included fear of getting
               infected and due to the public measures of social distancing.
               The consequences are late diagnoses and a worse prognosis. It
               might impact the healthcare systems around the world in the next

               0.001) as the major independent variable that affected sleep
               quality; the major independent variable associated with anxiety

               via PCR, disease severity (WHO score), inflammatory response of
               patients. Finally, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine was
               analyzed. RESULTS: High ACE-2 expression (3/3) was observed in
               the tubules of the kidney and prostate glands, moderate
               expression in urothelial cells of the bladder (0-2/3) and no
               expression in kidney glomeruli, muscularis of the bladder and
               stroma of the prostate (0/3). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in
               5/199 urine samples from 64 patients. Viral RNA was detected in
               the first urinary sample of sequential samples. Viral RNA load
               from other specimen as nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or
               endotracheal aspirates revealed higher levels than from urine.
               Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine was not associated with
               impaired WHO score (median 5, range 3-8 vs median 4, range 1-8,
               p = 0.314), peak white blood cell count (median 24.1 $\times$
               1000/ml, range 5.19-48.1 versus median 11.9 $\times$ 1000/ml,
               range 2.9-60.3, p = 0.307), peak CRP (median 20.7 mg/dl,
               4.2-40.2 versus median 11.9 mg/dl, range 0.1-51.9, p = 0.316) or
               peak IL-6 levels (median: 1442 ng/ml, range 26.7-3918 versus
               median 140 ng/ml, range 3.0-11,041, p = 0.099). SARS-CoV-2 RNA
               was stable under different storage conditions and after
               freeze-thaw cycles. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the urine of
               COVID-19 patients occurs infrequently. The viral RNA load and
               dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding suggest no relevant route of
               transmission through the urinary tract.",

               systems for evaluating COVID-19 patients has demonstrated
               potential for improving clinical decision making and assessing
               patient outcomes during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. These have
               been applied to many medical imaging tasks, including disease
               diagnosis and patient prognosis, as well as augmented other
               clinical measurements to better inform treatment decisions.
               Because these systems are used in life-or-death decisions,
               clinical implementation relies on user trust in the AI output.
               This has caused many developers to utilize explainability
               techniques in an attempt to help a user understand when an AI
               algorithm is likely to succeed as well as which cases may be
               problematic for automatic assessment, thus increasing the
               potential for rapid clinical translation. AI application to
               COVID-19 has been marred with controversy recently. This review
               discusses several aspects of explainable and interpretable AI as
               it pertains to the evaluation of COVID-19 disease and it can
               restore trust in AI application to this disease. This includes
               the identification of common tasks that are relevant to
               explainable medical imaging AI, an overview of several modern
               approaches for producing explainable output as appropriate for a

               explainable AI, and recommendations for best practices in
               explainable/interpretable AI implementation. This review will
               allow developers of AI systems for COVID-19 to quickly
               understand the basics of several explainable AI techniques and

               Primary outcome was the rate of seropositivity following 2 doses
               of COVID-19 vaccine with rates of seropositivity following 1
               dose, rates of positive neutralising antibody (nAb), cellular
               responses and adverse events as secondary outcomes. Rates were
               pooled from single arm studies while rates of seropositivity
               were compared against the rate in healthy controls for
               comparator studies using a random effects model and expressed as
               a pooled odds ratio with 95\% confidence intervals. Forty-four
               studies (16 mixed group, 28 disease specific) with 7064 patients
               were included in the analysis (2331 following first dose, 4733
               following second dose). Overall seropositivity rates were
               61-67\% following 2 doses and 37-51\% following 1 dose of
               COVID-19 vaccine. The lowest seropositivity rate was 51\% in CLL

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCWs) have been recognized as
               being at higher risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
               infection; however, relevant factors and magnitude have not been
               clearly elucidated. AIM: This study was aimed to describe
               COVID-19 infections among hospital employees at a large tertiary
               care hospital located in Ontario, Canada from March to July
               2020, towards better understanding potential risk factors.
               METHODS: Data on all HCWs with either a positive COVID test or a
               high-risk exposure from March to July 2020 were analyzed. HCWs
               with positive COVID test results and high-risk exposures were
               described. Those who developed COVID-19 following high-risk
               exposure were compared to those who did not. Data were also
               analyzed to determine trends over time. RESULTS: Over the period
               of observation, 193 staff (2\% of total working staff) had a
               positive COVID-19 test. Incidence of HCW infections closely
               followed community incidence. Overall, 31\% of COVID-19 cases
               were deemed occupationally acquired. Of these, 41\% were
               acquired from a patient, with the remainder (59\%) from fellow
               staff. Over the same period, 204 staff were identified as having
               a high-risk exposure. The majority of exposures (55\%) were
               patient-associated, with the remaining (45\%) resulting from
               staff-to-staff contact. Overall, 13\% went on to develop
               COVID-19. Of these cases, 58\% were patient-associated and 42\%
               were a result of staff-to-staff transmission. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs
               are at risk for work-related COVID-19. Given the number of
               infections attributed to staff-staff transmission, greater
               attention could be paid to implementing prevention measures in
               non-clinical areas.",

               COVID-19-related severe events. This study aimed to investigate
               the feasibility and safety of thoracic cancer surgery in the
               most severely affected European and Canadian regions during the
               COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study investigators
               prospectively collected data on surgical procedures for
               malignant thoracic diseases from January 1 to April 30, 2020.
               The study included patients from 6 high-volume thoracic surgery
               departments: Nancy and Strasbourg (France), Freiburg (Germany),
               Milan and Turin (Italy), and Montreal (Canada). The centers
               involved in this research are all located in the most severely
               affected regions of those countries. An assessment of
               COVID-19-related symptoms, polymerase chain reaction
               (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 infection, rates of hospital and
               intensive care unit admissions, and death was performed for each
               patient. Every deceased patient was tested for COVID-19 by PCR.
               RESULTS: In the study period, 731 patients who underwent 734
               surgical procedures were included. In the whole cohort, 9 cases
               (1.2\%) of COVID-19 were confirmed by PCR, including 5
               in-hospital contaminants. Four patients (0.5\%) needed
               readmission for oxygen requirements. In this subgroup, 2
               patients (0.3\%) needed intensive care unit and mechanical
               ventilatory support. The total number of deaths in the whole
               cohort was 22 (3\%). A single death was related to COVID-19
               (0.14\%). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining surgical oncologic activity
               in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic seems safe and feasible,
               with very low postoperative morbidity or mortality. To continue
               to offer the best care to patients who do not have COVID-19,

               became available, the leading oncology societies recommended two
               doses of COVID-19 vaccination to all patients with cancer with
               no specific recommendation for tumor type and active treatments.
               However, the data on the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in cancer
               patients is limited due to exclusion of cancer patients from
               most vaccine clinical trials. Therefore, we systemically
               reviewed the available evidence evaluating the antibody
               responses in cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic
               search from the Pubmed database and calculated risk differences
               (RD) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) to compare
               seroconversion rates between cancer patients and controls using
               the Review Manager software, version 5.3. Results: Our
               systematic search retrieved a total 27 studies and we included
               17 studies with control arms in the analyses. Cancer patients
               had significantly lower seroconversion rates (37.3\%) than
               controls (74.1\%) (RD: -0.44, 95\% CI: -0.52, -0.35, p<0.001)
               with first vaccine dose. After two doses, the seroconversion
               rates were 99.6\% in control arm and 78.3\% in cancer patients
               (RD: -0.19, 95\% CI: -0.28, -0.10, p<0.001). The difference in
               seroconversion rates was more pronounced patients with
               hematologic malignancies (72.6\%) (RD: -0.25, 95\% CI: -0.27,

               significantly lower in patients with hematological malignancies
               and patients under active treatment. Further research focusing

               increased 136.8\% to 1442 in 2021. Percentage of mammograms in
               patients with races other than White was 16.9\% in 2019, 12.2\%
               in 2020, and 18.0\% in 2021. Proportion performed at the urban
               center was 55.3\% in 2019, 42.2\% in 2020, and 45.9\% in 2021;
               proportion at suburban sites was 34.0\% in 2019, 49.2\% in 2020,
               and 43.5\% in 2021. Pre-COVID-19 volumes were reached by the
               sixth week after reopening for suburban sites, but not reached
               during early recovery for other sites. Proportion performed on
               Saturdays for suburban sites was similar across periods, while
               for the urban site was 7.6\% in 2019, 5.3\% in 2020, and 8.8\%
               in 2021; the community health center did not offer Saturday
               appointments during recovery. Conclusion: After reopening,
               screening shifted from urban to suburban settings, with
               disproportionate screening decrease in patients with races other
               than White. Initial delayed access at facilities serving
               underserved populations exacerbated disparities. Interventions
               to expand access resulted in late recovery volumes exceeding
               prepandemic volumes in patients with races other than White.
               Clinical Impact: Interventions to support equitable access
               across facilities serving diverse patient populations may
               mitigate potential widening disparities in breast cancer

               impact on treatment patterns for patients with metastatic cancer
               is unknown. We assessed the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on time
               to treatment initiation and treatment selection for patients
               newly diagnosed with metastatic solid cancer. METHODS: We used
               an electronic health record-derived longitudinal database
               curated via technology-enabled abstraction to identify 14,136 US
               patients newly diagnosed with de novo or recurrent metastatic
               solid cancer between January 1 and July 31 in 2019 or 2020.
               Patients received care at approximately 280 predominantly
               community-based oncology practices. Controlled interrupted time
               series analyses assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
               period (April-July 2020) on time to treatment initiation,
               defined as the number of days from metastatic diagnosis to
               receipt of first-line systemic therapy, and use of
               myelosuppressive therapy. RESULTS: The adjusted probability of
               treatment within 30 days of diagnosis was similar across periods
               (January-March 2019 = 41.7\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] =
               32.2\% to 51.1\%; April-July 2019 = 42.6\%, 95\% CI = 32.4\% to
               52.7\%; January-March 2020 = 44.5\%, 95\% CI = 30.4\% to 58.6\%;

               percentage-point difference-in-differences = 1.4\%, 95\% CI =
               -2.7\% to 5.5\%). Among 5,962 patients who received first-line
               systemic therapy, there was no association between the pandemic

               population thereby enabling non-pharmaceutical interventions and
               reducing disease spread. Previously, we developed a mathematical
               model predicting the order of symptoms based on data from the
               initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China using symptom occurrence
               at diagnosis and found that the order of COVID-19 symptoms
               differed from that of other infectious diseases including
               influenza. Whether this order of COVID-19 symptoms holds in the
               USA under changing conditions is unclear. Here, we use modeling
               to predict the order of symptoms using data from both the
               initial outbreaks in China and in the USA. Whereas patients in
               China were more likely to have fever before cough and then
               nausea/vomiting before diarrhea, patients in the USA were more
               likely to have cough before fever and then diarrhea before
               nausea/vomiting. Given that the D614G SARS-CoV-2 variant that
               rapidly spread from Europe to predominate in the USA during the
               first wave of the outbreak was not present in the initial China
               outbreak, we hypothesized that this mutation might affect
               symptom order. Supporting this notion, we found that as
               SARS-CoV-2 in Japan shifted from the original Wuhan reference
               strain to the D614G variant, symptom order shifted to the USA
               pattern. Google Trends analyses supported these findings, while
               weather, age, and comorbidities did not affect our model's
               predictions of symptom order. These findings indicate that
               symptom order can change with mutation in viral disease and
               raise the possibility that D614G variant is more transmissible
               because infected people are more likely to cough in public
               before being incapacitated with fever.",

               woman was admitted with severe headache and acute altered mental
               status a week after confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Magnetic
               resonance imaging brain showed diffuse venous sinus thrombosis

               outcomes (mRS <=2). The mortality rate was 39\% (13 patients).
               CONCLUSION: CVST should be in the differential diagnosis when
               patients present with acute neurological symptoms in this COVID
               pandemic. The mortality rate of CVST associated with COVID-19
               can be very high, therefore, early diagnosis and prompt
               treatment are crucial to the outcomes of these patients.",

               activity at Hospital Foch, Paris, France during the first French
               COVID lockdown in 2020. Additional goals include the evaluation

               DESIGN: Single-center, retrospective, chart-review cohort study
               in the gynecology department of Hospital Foch. Comparison of all
               patients scheduled, postponed and operated during the first
               COVID lockdown (March 14, to May 11, 2020) versus the same
               period in 2019. Postponed surgeries were classified into 4
               scheduling interval categories according to the Society of
               Gynecology Oncology (SGO) recommendations: urgent (without
               delay), semi-urgent (1-4 weeks), non-urgent (>4-12 weeks) and
               elective (>3 months) and evaluated to determine whether
               COVID-19-related delays of surgeries fell within guidelines. The
               potential ``loss of chance'' or medical risk associated with
               postponed surgeries was estimated according to a composite
               criterion including death, aggravation of expected tumor
               stages/grades in cancers, increase in surgical complexity
               compared to that initially planned, need for preoperative
               transfusions, start of morphine consumption during preoperative
               treatment for opiate-naive patients, additional hospitalization
               or consultations in emergency room and delay in treatment when
               surgery was urgent. RESULTS: During the 2020 French COVID
               lockdown, 61 patients had a surgical procedure and 114 were
               postponed; in the comparator 2019 group, 232 patients underwent
               surgical procedures, indicating an overall decrease of 65\% of
               activity. Analysis of differences between the two years revealed
               a reduction of 64\% in emergency procedures, 90\% of functional
               pathologies, and 13\% of cancers. According to SGO guidelines,
               the only type of surgical procedures that had excessive delay
               was the semi-urgent group, where time to surgery was 6.7 weeks
               [range 5.4-10 weeks] instead of the recommended interval of 1-4
               weeks. Among postponed surgeries there were 10 patients (8.7\%)
               with a potential ``loss of chance'' according to the composite
               criteria, all included in the semi-urgent group. CONCLUSION: The
               COVID 19 pandemic was responsible for a significant decrease of
               activity in the surgical department of Hospital Foch. Difficulty
               of rescheduling surgeries was responsible for an increased delay
               in semi-urgent operations. In almost 9\% of postponed surgeries,
               there was a potential ``loss of chance'', which likely
               represents only the tip of iceberg of collateral damages due to
               COVID 19 pandemic in this surgical unit. These data show the
               importance of continuing to treat pathologies requiring urgent
               or semi-urgent surgery during pandemics.",

               structural protein whose extracellular domain contains a
               receptor for L-thyroxine (T4). The integrin is expressed in
               rapidly dividing cells and its internalization is prompted by
               T4. The protein binds viruses and we have raised the possibility
               elsewhere that action of free T4 (FT4)-when he latter is
               increased in the nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) known to
               complicate COVID-19 infecction-may enhance cellular uptke of
               SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor. OBJECTIVE: Because T4 also acts
               nongenomically via the integrin to promote platelet aggregation
               and angiogenesis, we suggest here that T4 may contribute to the
               coagulopathy and endothelial abnormalities that can develop in
               COVID-19 infections, particularly when the lung is primary
               affected. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Elevated FT4 has been
               described in the NTIS of COVID-19 patients and may be associated
               with increased illness severity, but the finding of FT4
               elevation is inconsistent in the NTIS literature. Circulating
               3,5',3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (reverse T3, rT3) are frequently
               elevated in NTIS. Thought to be biologically inactive, rT3in
               fact stimulates cancer cell proliferation via avb3 and also may
               increase actin polymerization. We propose here that rT3 in the
               NTIS complicating systemic COVIF-19 infection may support
               coagulation and disordered blood vessel formation via actin
               polymerization.",

               treatment delays caused by the coronavirus disease 2019
               pandemic. Although there have been many reviews,
               recommendations, or clinical experiences, clinical evidence that
               evaluates patient disease status is lacking. The aim of our
               research was to evaluate thyroid cancer behaviour in the
               post-COVID-19 era. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study
               was conducted and thyroid cancer patient data from February 1,
               2017 to September 15, 2020 were pooled for analysis. The
               demographic, ultrasound and pathological data of the pre- and
               post-COVID-19 groups were compared. Lymph node metastases,
               tumour size, extrathyroidal extension, and multifocality were
               compared year-by-year to evaluate annual changes in patient
               characteristics. Regression analyses were adopted to reveal
               cancer behaviour along with the admission date interval and to
               reveal risk factors for lymph node metastasis. Patient
               ultrasound data were compared before and after the lockdown to
               assess tumour progression. The outcomes of delays in treatment
               $\leq$180 days were then studied. Results: The post-lockdown
               patients were more likely to have multiple lesions (31.2\% vs
               36.5\%, p = 0.040), extrathyroidal extension (65.5\% vs 72.2\%,
               p = 0.011) and lymph node metastases (37.7\% vs 45.0\%, p =
               0.007), while tumour size remained stable (1.01cm vs.1.02cm, p =
               0.758). The lymph node metastasis rate increased by year (p <
               0.001). The tumour size correlated negatively with the
               post-lockdown admission date (p = 0.002). No significant
               difference in tumour size, multifocality or lymph node
               metastasis on ultrasound was revealed between the pre- and
               post-lockdown group. No significant difference in tumour size,
               multifocality, extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastasis
               was revealed among patients with a delayed treatment time
               $\leq$180 days. Conclusion: Patients with a COVID-19-induced
               treatment delay had more aggressive cancer behaviour. Rebound
               medical visits and annually increasing aggressiveness may be
               potential reasons for this observation, as individual patient
               tumour did not progress during the delay.",

               infections and they are expected to be particularly vulnerable
               to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we have obtained a comprehensive

               a global scale using a federated data research network (TriNetX)

               mortality 9\%, 4.4-13.2) than non-MM patients. By interrogating
               large EMR datasets from HCO in Europe and globally, we confirmed
               that MM patients have been more severely impacted by COVID-19
               pandemic than non-MM patients. This study highlights the

  abstract = "Background and Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a national
              emergency in the United States in March 2020. The Centers for
              Medicare and Medicaid Services subsequently released
              recommendations that health-care facilities temporarily delay
              elective surgeries and non-essential medical procedures.
              Disruptions to medical care significantly impacted cancer
              patients, with cancer screenings halted and nonurgent cancer
              surgeries postponed as health-care facilities shifted resources
              toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it has been reported that
              cancer screening rates decreased dramatically in the United
              States in 2020, it is unclear whether this trend was driven by
              factors related to public interest in cancer and/or cancer
              screening as opposed to other factors such as clinical backlogs,
              pandemic-related policies, and/or resource limitations. The
              purpose of this study was to use the Google Trends tool to
              evaluate public interest in six common malignancies and four
              common cancer screening methods during the COVID-19 pandemic.
              Methods: We used the Google Trends tool to quantify public
              interest in six different malignancies (Breast Cancer, Colon
              Cancer, Lung Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, and
              Cervical Cancer) and four cancer screening methods (Pap Smear,
              Lung Cancer Screening, Mammogram, and Colonoscopy) in the United
              States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Welch's t-tests were used to
              compare monthly search volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic
              (2020) to the 4 years before the pandemic (2016 - 2019) for all
              ten search terms included in our study. We used

              was defined by choosing a false discovery rate of 0.05. Results:

              2016 - 2019 values. However, decreased public interest in cancer
              screening methods was temporary, with Google search volumes
              returning to pre-pandemic levels in June 2020 - December 2020.
              Conclusion: There was significantly reduced public interest in
              both common malignancies and cancer screening methods at the
              beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. However,
              after an initial decline, public interest as indicated by Google
              search volumes quickly returned to pre-pandemic levels in the
              second half of the calendar year 2020. In addition, trends in
              public interest in cancer screening as indicated by Google search
              volumes aligned with cancer screening uptake rates in the United
              States during the study period. This finding suggests that Google
              Trends may serve as an effective tool in gauging the public's
              interest in cancer and/or cancer screenings in the United States,
              which makes it a valuable resource that can be used to inform
              decisions aimed at improving cancer screening rates in the
              future. Relevance for Patients: The Google Trends tool can be
              used to measure public interest in various malignancies and their
              associated screening methods. Google Trends data may be used to
              inform measures aimed at improving cancer screening uptake.",

               prevent infections and control epidemics, but it also raises
               concerns about safety in patients receiving treatments. This
               study aimed to investigate the rate and factors for
               unvaccination, as well as adverse reactions and deterioration of
               disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in psoriatic patients.
               Methods: A web-based questionnaire survey on SARS-CoV-2
               vaccination, adverse reactions, and self-reported change of
               disease condition after vaccination in patients with psoriasis
               was conducted. Demographic, clinical, and psychological data
               were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used in
               the estimation of associations. Results: A total of 788
               psoriatic patients were investigated, and 68.9\% reported
               SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Younger age, use of interleukin-17
               inhibitors, and symptoms of anxiety were associated with
               unvaccination. The incidence of overall adverse reactions after
               vaccination was 30.8\%, and no severe adverse reaction was
               reported. The most common local and systemic adverse reactions
               were pain at the injection site and fatigue, respectively. Most
               patients reported no change in psoriasis after vaccination,
               while 16.6\% and 4.4\% reported slight and significant
               deteriorations of the disease, respectively. Nonadherence to
               treatment, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and perceived
               stress were associated with self-reported deterioration of
               psoriasis after vaccination. Conclusion: While a favorable
               safety profile of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is observed, receiving
               biologic treatment is factor for unvaccination in patients with
               psoriasis. Deterioration of psoriasis reported by a small
               proportion of patients is partially attributable to mental and
               behavioral factors.",

               measures (PROMs) in a mixed oncology population, focusing on
               those with treatable but not curable cancers. MATERIALS AND
               METHODS: Over a 9-month period, patients were invited to
               register with My Clinical Outcomes (MCO) - a secure online
               platform for the collection of electronic PROMs. They were
               prompted by e-mail to complete assessments (EORTC QLQ-C30,
               EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D VAS) routinely every 2 weeks. The team
               monitored patient scores and changes in these prompted clinical
               interventions. RESULTS: In total, 324 patients completed at
               least one assessment. The median number of assessments completed
               by each patient was eight. The most represented tumour groups

               changes in their daily activities in an effort to reduce the
               risk of infection. More than 40\% of the survivors reported some
               disruption in their access to medical care. A substantial
               proportion of the survivors (>40\%) reported feeling anxious,
               depressed, and/or isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
               Approximately 40\% of the patients reported changes in health
               behaviors shown to negatively affect survivorship outcomes
               (physical inactivity, smoking, and alcohol use) as a result of
               the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of the COVID-19
               pandemic on African American cancer survivors is substantial: it
               has affected both their physical and mental health. Coupled with
               changes in health behaviors, these factors will likely affect
               outcomes in this high-risk patient population, and this makes
               further study and interventions necessary to mitigate the
               long-term impact of the pandemic on cancer outcomes.",

               medication delivery service (MDS) significantly. MDS improves
               adherence to medication and clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To
               study behavioral change factors that affect adoption of MDS,
               determine existing patient satisfaction level, and make
               recommendations to improve MDS adoption. METHODS: A
               single-institution, cross-sectional survey was conducted at the
               outpatient pharmacy of the largest ambulatory cancer centre in
               Singapore. The survey consisted of sections on demographics,
               Theory of Planned Behavior constructs and patient satisfaction
               questions. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were
               used. RESULTS: A total of 881 patients responded. Respondents
               were mostly Chinese, female and subsidized patients, with a mean
               age of 62.4 years old. MDS use is strongly predicted by
               favourable attitude (OR 3.54, 95\%CI 2.64-4.75; p < 0.001) and
               subjective norm (OR 3.07, 95\%CI 2.30-4.09; p < 0.001) towards
               its use and greater perceived behavioral control (OR 2.48;
               95\%CI 1.86-3.30; p < 0.001). Being ill or frail has been
               identified as facilitators, while absence of face-to-face
               consultation and cost of delivery were barriers to the adoption
               of MDS. Encouragingly, the satisfaction level of our existing
               patients was generally high (80.2, SD16.7). Recommendation to
               improve MDS adoption targets facilitators and barriers
               identified and aims to further elevate patient satisfaction
               level. Establishment of a centralised pharmacy for MDS together
               with a call centre would be essential in the long run.
               CONCLUSIONS: MDS is becoming increasingly important, in line
               with our national strategy. Implementation of suggested
               short-term and long-term measures will encourage its use.",

  abstract  = "Introduction: The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has posed many new
               challenges to the health care and the timing of surgical care.
               At the beginning of the pandemic many guidelines recommended
               postponing elective surgical procedures to reallocate resources.
               As regards, delay in cancer treatment could be effective on
               cancer progression. The aim of this systematic review was to
               outline a guideline for preoperative screening before cancer
               surgeries and protecting health care workers during the
               pandemic. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted
               through a search in electronic databases up to August 2020.
               PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and
               Google Scholar databases were searched without time limitation.
               The keywords were a combination of preoperative, cancer surgery,
               COVID-19, and their synonyms. Results: The most commonly used
               ways to triage preoperatively were telephone pre-assessment for
               suspicious symptoms and history of contact or travel, 14-day
               self-isolation, in- hospital queries at admission, temperature
               monitoring, and isolation in a single room COVID-free ward or
               physical distancing. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
               reaction (RT-PCR) test 24-72 h before operation was recommended
               commonly, except in inaccessible centers, but non-contrast
               chest-CT scan is not routinely advised for elective surgeries to
               salvage medical resources. Recommended personal protective
               equipment (PPE) for staffs were wearing N95 mask in addition to
               gown, gloves, eye protection in aerosol-generating procedures
               (AGPs), and wearing gloves, hats, and disposable surgical masks,
               practice distancing, and hand hygiene for all staffs. Meanwhile
               team separation of hospital staffs caring for COVID-19 patients,
               segregated areas for COVID-19 clean and contact, restriction of
               visitors and family members, and personal distancing are mostly
               recommended. Conclusion: We hope this review would be a guidance
               for triage, preoperative testing, and summarizing safety

               diagnostic activity relevant to cancer are available. We
               examined trends in the provision of full diagnostic tests for
               consecutive patients with suspected cancer referred to an
               academic hospital-based Quick Diagnosis Unit from January 2019
               to December 2020. As weekly volumes declined, waiting times for
               endoscopic, imaging and biopsy/cytology procedures increased
               steeply during the COVID-impacted period (26 February-28 April
               2020). The average weekly increase compared with the same period
               in 2019 was substantial for invasive procedures requiring
               admission (200.70\%), CT scans (171.20\%), GI endoscopy

               infected with COVID-19. It is critical to understand the impact
               of DM on mortality and other clinical outcomes of COVID-19
               infection from this region. Aims The primary objective of our
               study was to analyze the mortality rate in people with DM
               infected with COVID-19. The secondary objectives were to assess
               the effect of various comorbidities on mortality and study the
               impact of DM on other clinical outcomes. Methods This is a
               retrospective study of COVID-19 infected patients admitted to a
               tertiary care hospital in north India in the early phase of the
               pandemic. Results Of the 1211 cases admitted, 19 were excluded
               because of incomplete data, and 1192 cases were finally
               considered for analysis. DM constituted 26.8\% of total
               patients. The overall mortality rate was 6.1\%, and the rate was
               10.7\% in the presence of diabetes (p < 0.01, OR 2.55). In
               univariate analysis, increased age, chronic kidney disease
               (CKD), coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and cancer were
               associated with mortality. On multiple logistic regression, the
               independent predictors of mortality were CAD, CKD, and cancer.
               Breathlessness and low SpO2 at presentation, extensive
               involvement in CXR, and elevated ANC/ALC ratio were also
               significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions The
               presence of comorbidities such as DM, hypertension, CAD, CKD,
               and cancer strongly predict the risk of mortality in COVID-19
               infection. Early triaging and aggressive therapy of patients

               globally. The purpose of this systematic review and
               meta-analysis is to identify the prevalence of the clinical
               symptoms of patient with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic review
               and meta-analysis were carried out. The following databases were
               searched: PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, medRxiv,
               and Google Scholar, from December 1st, 2019 to January 1st,
               2021. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a

               (I2) statistics. RESULTS: A total of 215 studies, involving
               132,647 COVID-19 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The
               pooled prevalence of the four most common symptoms were fever
               76.2\% (n = 214; 95\% CI 73.9-78.5); coughing 60.4\% (n = 215;

               and dyspnea 26.2\% (n = 195; 95\% CI 24.1-28.5). Other symptoms
               from highest to lowest in terms of prevalence include
               expectorant (22.2\%), anorexia (21.6\%), myalgias (17.5\%),
               chills (15\%), sore throat (14.1\%), headache (11.7\%), nausea
               or vomiting (8.7\%), rhinorrhea (8.2\%), and hemoptysis (3.3\%).
               In subgroup analyses by continent, it was found that four
               symptoms have a slight prevalence variation-fever, coughing,
               fatigue, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found the

               by an ever-increasing scarcity of medical resources due to the
               ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The
               aim of this study was to investigate the impact of remdesivir on
               the demand of hospital bed capacities for hospitalized COVID-19
               patients and to evaluate the potentially created capacities for
               treating additional COVID-19 patients or elective treatments at
               the hospital. METHODS: An epidemiological model was developed
               that utilized the population of Cologne (Germany) during the
               first COVID-19 wave (first hospitalized patient-30 September
               2020) to compare two scenarios: no administration of remdesivir
               (A) and the administration of remdesivir according to the EMA
               label (B). The results of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial
               were used to evaluate the potential impact of remdesivir on
               hospital capacity. RESULTS: With the first recorded patient on 2
               March 2020, a total of 576 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were
               detected during the first wave in Cologne. Comparing both
               scenarios (A versus B) of the model, the administration of
               remdesivir increased the number of discharges from 259 to 293
               (+5.8\%) and fewer patients needed ICU admission [214 versus 178
               (-6.3\%)]. In addition, the model estimated 20 fewer deaths
               (scenario B). Based on a reduced length of stay, 31.4 hospital
               beds (57.0 versus 25.6) could have been freed by administering
               remdesivir to eligible patients. This would have allowed either
               the treatment of an additional 730 COVID-19 patients or 660
               elective treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In our model, remdesivir
               administration profoundly contributed to free hospital
               capacities in the metropolitan city Cologne in Germany.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Synthesis of available evidence on clinical practice in
              gynaecological oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic is highly
              warranted, as women with cancer are at increased risk due to
              their systemic immunosuppressed state and changes in their care
              are inevitable. Rapid review of available data is a quick way of
              providing useful information and insight into the way medical
              practice has been affected by the COVID pandemic. METHODS: We
              conducted a systematic rapid review, based on a literature search
              of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL. We considered
              all studies on gynaecological oncology care during the COVID-19
              pandemic using relevant keywords and MeSH terms. Selection
              criteria were English language, studies with more than five cases
              and publication in peer-review journal. RESULTS: Nine
              retrospective studies, one systematic review and five
              questionnaire surveys were included. Quality of the studies has
              been assessed. Development of higher quality evidence is
              warranted. Mortality of COVID-19 infection is higher in patients
              with gynaecological cancer than in non-cancer patients. Reported
              delays in diagnosis and management of cancer and changes in
              treatments, may affect the natural history of cancer and increase
              patients' anxiety and fear of disease progression while causing
              concerns to healthcare professionals affecting their clinical
              practice. The number of new diagnoses has declined.
              Prioritization is important, face-to-face interactions should be
              limited, and appropriate protective measures are essential.
              Cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy should continue as
              high priority practices. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has
              affected clinical practice significantly. Adaptations in clinical

               patients with cancer were excluded from serum antisevere acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine
               registration trials, it is still unknown whether they would
               develop a protective antispike antibody response after
               vaccination. This prospective vaccine monitoring study primarily
               aimed to assess humoral responses to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in
               patients with thoracic cancer. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-spike
               antibodies were measured using the Abbot Architect SARS-CoV-2
               immunoglobulin G immunoassay before the first injection of
               BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, at week 4, and 2 to 16 weeks after the
               second vaccine dose administration. The factors associated with
               antibody response were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 306 patients,
               with a median age of 67.0 years (interquartile range: 58-74),
               were vaccinated. Of these, 283 patients received two vaccine
               doses at 28-day intervals. After a 6.7-month median follow-up,
               eight patients (2.6\%) contracted proven symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
               infection, with rapid favorable evolution. Of the 269 serologic
               results available beyond day 14 after the second vaccine dose
               administration, 17 patients (6.3\%) were still negative (<50
               arbitrary units/mL, whereas 34 (11\%) were less than 300
               arbitrary units/mL (12.5th percentile). In multivariate
               analysis, only age (p < 0.01) and long-term corticosteroid
               treatment (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with a lack
               of immunization. A total of 30 patients received a third vaccine
               dose, with only three patients showing persistently negative
               serology thereafter, whereas the others exhibited clear
               seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV2 vaccines were found to be
               efficient in patients with thoracic cancer, most of them being
               immunized after two doses. A third shot given to 1\% of patients
               with persistent low antibody titers resulted in an 88\%

               healthcare services, protect healthcare providers, and help them
               maintain satisfactory quality and safety of care. Remote
               COVID-19 monitoring platforms emerged as potential solutions.
               Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
               capacity and contribution of two different platforms used to
               remotely monitor patients with COVID-19 to maintain quality,
               safety, and patient engagement in care, as well as their
               acceptability, usefulness, and user-friendliness from the user's
               perspective. The first platform is focused on telecare phone
               calls (Telecare-Covid), and the second is a telemonitoring app
               (CareSimple-Covid). Methods: We performed a cross-sectional
               study. The data were collected through a phone survey from May
               to August 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics
               and t-test analysis. Participants' responses and comments on
               open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis to
               identify certain issues and challenges and potential avenues for
               improving the platforms. Results: Fifty one patients
               participated in the study. Eighteen participants used the
               CareSimple-Covid platform and 33 participants used the
               Telecare-Covid platform. Overall, the satisfaction rate for
               quality and safety of care for the two platforms was 80\%. Over
               88\% of the users on each platform considered the platforms'
               services to be engaging, useful, user-friendly, and appropriate
               to their needs. The survey identified a few significant
               differences in users' perceptions of each platform: empathy
               toward users and the quality and safety of the care received
               were rated significantly higher on the CareSimple-Covid platform
               than on the Telecare-Covid platform. Users appreciated four
               aspects of these telehealth approaches: (1) the ease of access
               to services and the availability of care team members; (2) the
               user-friendliness of the platforms; (3) the continuity of care
               provided, and (4) the wide range of services delivered. Users
               identified some technical limitations and raised certain issues,
               such as the importance of maintaining human contact, data
               security, and confidentiality. Improvement suggestions include
               promoting access to connected devices; enhancing communications
               between institutions, healthcare users, and the public on
               confidentiality and personal data protection standards; and
               integrating a participatory approach to telehealth platform
               development and deployment efforts. Conclusion: This study
               provides preliminary evidence that the two remote monitoring
               platforms are well-received by users, with very few significant
               differences between them concerning users' experiences and
               views. This type of program could be considered for use in a
               post-pandemic era and for other post-hospitalization clienteles.
               To maximize efficiency, the areas for improvement and the issues
               identified should be addressed with a patient-centered approach.",

               immune-suppressive requires extra care. METHOD: Among 108 lung
               cancer patients who had been hospitalized during the COVID-19
               pandemic, 18 with respiratory symptoms were evaluated
               retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients' median age was 64 $\pm$
               9.4 with a male predominance (male n = 16, female n = 2).
               Thirteen had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 5 had small
               cell lung cancer (SCLC). Nine (50\%) patients were receiving
               chemotherapy. The most common symptom was shortness of breath (n
               = 14, 77.8\%), followed by fever (n = 10, 55.6\%). The findings
               confirmed on computed thorax tomography (CTT) were as follows:
               consolidation (n = 8, 44.4\%), ground glass opacities (n = 8,
               44.4\%) and thoracic tumour/mediastinal-hilar lymphadenopathy (n
               = 3, 16.7\%). Hypoxia was seen in 11 patients (61.1\%), twelve
               patients had an elevated LDH (median = 302 $\pm$ 197) and
               lymphopenia (median = 1055 $\pm$ 648) and 5 (27.7\%) were highly
               suspected of having contracted COVID-19. None of their
               nasopharyngeal swaps was positive. Two of these 5 patients
               received COVID-19 specific treatment even though they thrice had
               negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
               (RT-PCR) results. The two patients responded well to both
               clinical and radiological treatments. For one case with SCLC
               receiving immunotherapy, methylprednisolone was initiated for
               radiation pneumonitis after excluding COVID-19. CONCLUSION: In

               patient applications, new diagnoses and treatment approaches in
               a non-infected hospital. METHODS: We collected data from the
               first peak of the pandemic period in Turkey, from the pandemic
               declaration (11 March 2020) to social normalization (1 June
               2020), and compared it with the data from a pre-pandemic period
               with a similar length of time. We analyzed the data of breast
               cancer patients from application to surgery. RESULTS: The data
               of 34 577 patients were analyzed for this study. The number of
               patients who applied to outpatient clinics decreased

               neoadjuvant treatment (21 vs. 25). Surgical treatment approaches
               also changed. However, the rate of newly diagnosed breast cancer
               patients treated with surgery was similar in both periods. None
               of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 or died during
               the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This study shows that non-infected

               cancer (NMIBC). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed
               using an Italian multi-institutional database of TURBT patients
               with high-risk urothelial NMIBC between January 2019 and
               February 2021, followed by Re-TURBT and/or adjuvant intravesical
               BCG. RESULTS: A total of 2591 patients from 27 institutions with
               primary TURBT were included. Of these, 1534 (59.2\%) and 1056
               (40.8\%) underwent TURBT before and during the COVID-19
               outbreak, respectively. Time between diagnosis and TURBT was
               significantly longer during the COVID-19 period (65 vs. 52 days,
               p = 0.002). One thousand and sixty-six patients (41.1\%)
               received Re-TURBT, 604 (56.7\%) during the pre-COVID-19. The
               median time to secondary resection was significantly longer
               during the COVID-19 period (55 vs. 48 days, p < 0.0001). A total
               of 977 patients underwent adjuvant intravesical therapy after
               primary or secondary resection, with a similar distribution
               across the two groups (n = 453, 86\% vs. n = 388, 86.2\%).

               challenges and restrictions in surgical access across Canada,
               including for breast reconstructive services which are an
               integral component of comprehensive breast cancer care. We
               sought to determine how breast reconstructive services are being
               restricted, and what strategies may be employed to optimize the
               provision of breast reconstruction through a pan-Canadian
               evaluation from the providers' perspective. Methods: This was a
               cross-sectional survey of Canadian plastic and reconstructive
               surgeons who perform breast reconstruction. The 33-item
               web-based questionnaire was developed by a pan-Canadian working
               group of breast reconstruction experts and disseminated via
               email to members of the Canadian Society of Plastic Surgery. The
               questionnaire queried respondents on the impact of the COVID-19
               pandemic and associated restrictions on surgeons' breast
               reconstruction practice patterns and opinions on strategies for
               resource utilization. Results: Responses were received from 49
               surgeons, who reported practicing in 8 of 10 Canadian provinces.
               Restrictions on the provision of breast reconstructive
               procedures were most limited during the First Wave of the
               COVID-19 pandemic, where all respondents reported at least some
               reduction in capacity and more than a quarter reporting complete
               cessation. Average reported reduction in capacity ranged from
               31\% to 78\% across all 3 waves. Autologous, delayed, and
               prophylactic reconstructions were most commonly restricted.

               on breast reconstructive services during the COVID-19 pandemic
               from the providers' perspective. To uphold the standards of

               disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection owing to their working

               Compliance with infection control measures in examination
               offices can lessen the risk of infection to this group. In
               Egypt, several deaths from COVID-19 have been reported among
               ophthalmologists; therefore, we studied the prevalence of
               COVID-19 infections in this group and assessed ophthalmologists'
               commitments to recommended infection control measures. Aim: To
               evaluate the rate of COVID-19 infections among ophthalmologists,
               identify risk factors for infections, and evaluate
               ophthalmologists' commitments to infection control measures in
               their medical facilities. Methods: An online questionnaire was
               designed and distributed to ophthalmologists in the Cairo
               Governorate from May 1, 2021 to mid-June 2021. Results: Out of
               161 responders, the percentage of COVID-19 infections was 52.8\%
               (85 responders). This was significantly higher among younger
               ophthalmologists (P-value = 0.019) and those with fewer years of
               experience (P-value = 0.010). Adopting full precautions while
               examining patients with or without respiratory illness were
               significantly associated with a lower infection rate (P-value =
               0.019 and 0.046, respectively). A significantly higher infection
               rate was reported for ophthalmologists who examined known
               COVID-19 patients at outpatient clinics, even when taking
               precautions (P-value = 0.032). A lower rate of COVID-19

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Management of patients with cancer in the current
               era of the COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant challenge to
               health care systems. Breast cancer is the most common cancer
               internationally. Breast cancer is a disease that involves
               surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy,
               radiotherapy, and, more recently, immunotherapy in its
               management plan. The immune system requires months to recover
               from these medications, and this condition is even worse in
               patients with metastatic breast cancer who need ongoing
               treatment with these drugs. Some of these drugs, such as
               inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, can cause rare
               but life-threating lung inflammation. Patients with breast
               cancer who have metastatic disease to the lungs can experience
               deterioration of disease symptoms with COVID-19 infection.
               Oncologists treating patients with breast cancer are facing a
               difficult situation regarding treatment choice. The impact that
               COVID-19 has had on breast cancer care is unknown, including how
               to provide the best care possible without compromising patient
               and community safety. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to
               explore the views of oncologists regarding the management of
               patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
               METHODS: A web-based SurveyMonkey questionnaire was submitted to
               licensed oncologists involved in breast cancer management in
               Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates. The survey
               focused on characteristics of the participants, infection risk
               among patients with cancer, and possible treatment modifications
               related to different types of breast cancer. RESULTS: The survey
               was completed by 82 participants. For early hormone receptor
               (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
               (HER2)-negative breast cancer, 61 of the 82 participants (74\%)
               supported using neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in selected
               patients, and 58\% (48/82) preferred giving 6 over 8 cycles of
               adjuvant chemotherapy when indicated. Only 43\% (35/82)
               preferred inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 with
               hormonal therapy as the first-line treatment in all patients
               with metastatic HR-positive disease. A total of 55 of the 82
               participants (67\%) supported using adjuvant trastuzumab for 6
               instead of 12 months in selected patients with HER2-positive
               breast cancer. For metastatic HER2-positive, HR-positive breast
               cancer, 80\% of participants (66/82) supported the use of
               hormonal therapy with dual anti-HER2 blockade in selected
               patients. The preferred choice of first-line treatment in
               metastatic triple negative patients with BRCA mutation and

               (58/82) of the participants. CONCLUSIONS: Several modifications
               in breast cancer management were supported by the survey
               participants. These modifications need to be discussed on a
               local basis, taking into account the local infrastructure and

               patients hospitalized to treat COVID-19 in Brazil's public
               health system. We compared patients with the active use of ADT

               propensity score models of patients in active versus non-active
               use of ADT. All variables were used to derive propensity score
               estimation in both models. In the first model we performed a
               pair-matched propensity score model between those under active
               and non-active use of ADT. To the second model we initially
               performed a multivariate backward elimination process to select
               variables to a final inverse-weight adjusted with double robust
               estimation model. RESULTS: We analyzed 199 PC patients with
               COVID-19 that received ADT. In total, 52.3\% (95/199) of our
               patients were less than 75 years old, 78.4\% (156/199) were on
               active ADT, and most were using a GnRH analog (80.1\%; 125/156).
               Most of patients were in palliative treatment (89.9\%; 179/199).
               Also, 63.3\% of our cohort died from COVID-19. Forty-eight
               patients under active ADT were pair matched against 48 controls

               significant imbalance in the propensity score of patients in
               active and those in non-active ADT, with important reductions in
               the differences after the adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: The active

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
               has resulted in a widespread adoption of telehealth (phone and
               video consultations) in cancer care worldwide. The aim of this
               study was to determine patient satisfaction with telehealth
               consultations with their medical oncologist at a tertiary cancer
               centre in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: Patients who attended a
               routine telehealth appointment at the medical oncology
               outpatient clinic were recruited to complete a questionnaire
               containing 16 items, each on a 5-point Likert scale regarding
               satisfaction levels in various aspects of telehealth and their
               willingness to continue telehealth after the pandemic. Patients
               were also invited to provide suggestions for improvement.
               RESULTS: In total, 150 patients were invited to participate, and
               103 valid questionnaires were returned. Median age was 63 years
               (range: 25-90), 49\% of patients were male, 63\% of patients had
               advanced cancer and 81\% were on active treatment. In total,
               95\% of participants indicated that they were satisfied (score
               $\geq$4) with telehealth. 82\% of participants preferred to
               continue telehealth consultations after the coronavirus disease
               2019 pandemic, but ideally with a mix of telehealth and
               in-person consultations. Phone appointments (vs. video, p <
               0.002), patients with advanced cancer (vs. early, p < 0.036) and
               pre-chemotherapy/immunotherapy/targeted therapy treatment
               reviews (vs. follow-up appointments, p < 0.001) were
               significantly associated with a willingness to continue
               telehealth. DISCUSSION: Patients were overwhelmingly satisfied
               with telehealth during the study period and were willing to
               continue telehealth for some appointments beyond the coronavirus
               disease 2019 pandemic. More research into the effectiveness,
               safety and implementation of telehealth to compliment
               traditional face-to-face services for patient-centred cancer

               cancer, as these are the most common tumors that involve the
               pericardium. Here, we present a 54-year-old male with no known

               the 2208 new referrals in 2020 (n=922) and 2019 (n=1286) with
               $X$2 and Mann-Whitney U tests and calculated ORs with binary
               logistic regression. To evaluate the expected changes in the
               cancer survival secondary to stage migration, we used the 5-year
               survival data of Survival, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
               Program 2010-2016. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with
               inoperable or metastatic disease was significantly increased
               during the pandemic (49.8\% vs 39\%, OR: 1.553, 95\% CI: 1.309
               to 1.843, p<0.001). We observed a significant decrease in the
               percentage of patients diagnosed via the screening methods
               (18.8\% vs 28.7\%, OR: 1.698, 95\% CI: 1.240 to 2.325, p=0.001).
               The 90-day mortality after the cancer diagnosis was

               1.661, 95\% CI: 1.225 to 2.252, p=0.001). Due to the increased

               possible differences between swab results in the trachea and in
               the nasopharynx of this category of patients. METHODS: A
               retrospective chart review was performed in April 2021 among
               patients who previously had been operated on for total
               laryngectomy and who underwent swabs for SARS-CoV-2 research in
               3 health-care centers in Northern-Eastern Italy. Data regarding

               of the resources of the National Health System and the necessity
               to formulate novel practice recommendation for oncological care.
               To date there are not available any management guidelines for
               cancer patients in case of pandemic. Each center has tried to
               manage its own needs and requests independently, often reducing
               access to treatment and diagnostic exams to patients. Here we
               have described the management of cancer patients during COVID-19
               infection with suggestions of some practical approaches applied
               by our Regional Center for Oncological Orientation (COrO) in
               S.G. Moscati Hospital (Taranto-Italy). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Our
               strategies were the minimization of interruption of cancer
               treatment through the extension of Taranto's Health Regional
               (CorO). The extension of oncological network, assisted by the
               General Management of Taranto ASL through agreements with
               private structures in Taranto 's area allowed cancer patients to
               receive up to 11 different types of services, according to their
               needs(first investigation or follow up)and representing an
               exclusive organization on the entire Italian territory. RESULTS:
               Thanks to the organization of the COrO in 2020, 1406 first
               oncological visits and 566 preparatory treatments were carried
               out, 372 of exemption for oncological pathology (free health
               care) were activated, 1742 instrumental investigations and 7
               cases of civil invalidity were performed(certificate of
               disability). CONCLUSIONS: We have overcome the barriers to care
               of oncology patients that has led to a total reduction of
               waiting lists representing a practical application model that
               can be extended in to other healthcare settings.",

               RESULTS: Results: Of the 996,500 members of the Inspire health
               community who were invited to participate responses were
               received from 21,943 individuals (2.2\%). Respondents resided in
               123 countries (74\% USA), had a median age range 56-65 years,
               were highly educated (60\% holding college or post-graduate
               degrees), and had diverse political leanings. All respondents
               self-reported at least one co-morbidity, with 27\% having
               cancer, 23\% autoimmune diseases, and 38\% chronic lung
               diseases. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was identified in 18.6\%,
               with 2190 (10.3\%) declaring that they would not, 742 (3.4\%)
               stating that they probably would not, and 1028 (4.8\%) not sure
               whether they would agree to be vaccinated. Hesitancy was
               expressed by 13.4\% cancer patients, 19.4\% with autoimmune
               diseases, and 17.8\% with chronic lung diseases. Positive
               predictors of vaccine acceptance included routine influenza
               vaccination (odds ratio 1.53), trust in responsible vaccine
               development (odds ratio 14.04), residing in the USA (odds ratio
               1.31) and never smoker status (odds ratio 1.06). Hesitancy was
               increased with a history of prior COVID-19 (odds ratio .86),
               conservative political leaning (odds ratio .93), younger age
               (odds ratio .83), and lower education level (odds ratio .90).
               One quarter (5501 participants) had received at least one
               COVID-19 vaccine injection and 1390 (6.2\%) completed a two-dose
               series. Following the first injection, 69\% self-reported local
               and 40\% systemic reactions, which increased following the
               second injection to 76\% and 67\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
               Conclusions: In this survey of individuals with serious comorbid
               conditions significant vaccine hesitancy remains. Assumptions
               that the most vulnerable would automatically accept COVID-19
               vaccination are erroneous and thus call for healthcare team
               members to initiate discussions focusing on the impact of the
               vaccine on an individual's underlying condition. Early
               self-reported side-effect experiences among those who have
               already been vaccinated, as expressed by our population, should
               be reassuring and might be utilized to alleviate vaccine fears.
               Healthcare related social media forums which rapidly disseminate
               accurate information about the COVID-19 vaccine may play an
               important role.",

               databases were searched to retrieve articles on readmitted
               COVID-19 patients, available up to September 25, 2021. All
               studies comparing characteristics of readmitted and
               non-readmitted COVID-19 patients were included. We also included
               articles reporting the reasons for readmission in COVID-19
               patients. Data were pooled and meta-analyzed using random or
               fixed-effect models, as appropriate. Subgroup analyses were
               conducted based on the place and duration of readmission.
               RESULTS: Our meta-analysis included 4823 readmitted and 63,413
               non-readmitted COVID-19 patients. The re-hospitalization rate
               was calculated at 9.3\% with 95\% Confidence Interval (CI)

               comorbidities, and older age were associated with a higher risk
               of readmission among previously admitted COVID-19 patients.
               These factors can help clinicians and policy-makers predict, and

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
               is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus. Favipiravir is an
               orally administrable antiviral drug whose mechanism of action is
               to selectively inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. A
               preliminary trial in COVID-19 patients reported significant
               improvements across a multitude of clinical parameters, but
               these findings have not been confirmed in an adequate
               well-controlled trial. We conducted a randomized, single-blind,
               placebo-controlled Phase III trial assessing the efficacy and
               safety of favipiravir in patients with moderate pneumonia not
               requiring oxygen therapy. METHODS: COVID-19 patients with
               moderate pneumonia (SpO2 $\geq$ 94\%) within 10 days of onset of
               fever (temperature $\geq$ 37.5 °C) were assigned to receive
               either placebo or favipiravir (1800 mg twice a day on Day 1,
               followed by 800 mg twice a day for up to 13 days) in a ratio of
               1:2. An adaptive design was used to re-estimate the sample size.
               The primary endpoint was a composite outcome defined as the time
               to improvement in temperature, oxygen saturation levels (SpO2),
               and findings on chest imaging, and recovery to
               SARS-CoV-2-negative. This endpoint was re-examined by the
               Central Committee under blinded conditions. RESULTS: A total of
               156 patients were randomized. The median time of the primary
               endpoint was 11.9 days in the favipiravir group and 14.7 days in
               the placebo group, with a significant difference (p = 0.0136).
               Favipiravir-treated patients with known risk factors such as
               obesity or coexisting conditions provided better effects.
               Furthermore, patients with early-onset in the favipiravir group
               showed higher odds ratio. No deaths were documented. Although
               adverse events in the favipiravir group were predominantly
               transient, the incidence was significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS:
               The results suggested favipiravir may be one of options for
               moderate COVID-19 pneumonia treatment. However, the risk of
               adverse events, including hyperuricemia, should be carefully
               considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.jp number:

               patients, particularly from India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
               was an observational, single-centre, retrospective analysis of
               patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalised in our
               institution between 22 May 2020 and 1 December 2020. We compared
               baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters and
               outcomes of COVID-19 (overall mortality, time to discharge)
               between cancer and non-cancer patients. RESULTS: A total of 200
               COVID-19 infection episodes were analysed of which 109 (54.5\%)
               were patients with cancer and 91 (45.5\%) were patients without
               cancer. The median age was 43 (interquartile range [IQR]:32-57),
               51 (IQR: 33-62) and 38 (IQR: 31.5-49.3) years; of whole cohort,

               outcomes showed that oxygen requirement (31.2\% [95\% CI:
               22.6-40.7] vs. 17.6\% [95\% CI: 10.4-26.9]; p = 0.03), median
               time to discharge (11 days [IQR: 6.75-16] vs. 6 days [IQR:
               3-9.75]; p 1 mg\% (12.8\% vs. 0\%; p = 0.027; OR: 24.69), serum

               patients with cancer have improved in terms of disease
               management and capacity is yet to be defined. Objective: To test
               whether severity and mortality from COVID-19 among patients with
               cancer have improved during the course of the pandemic. Design,
               Setting, and Participants: OnCovid is a European registry that
               collects data on consecutive patients with solid or hematologic
               cancer and COVID-19. This multicenter case series study included
               real-world data from 35 institutions across 6 countries (UK,
               Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, and Germany). This update
               included patients diagnosed between February 27, 2020, and
               February, 14, 2021. Inclusion criteria were confirmed diagnosis
               of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a history of solid or hematologic
               cancer. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and
               Measures: Deaths were differentiated at 14 days and 3 months as
               the 2 landmark end points. Patient characteristics and outcomes
               were compared by stratifying patients across 5 phases (February
               to March 2020, April to June 2020, July to September 2020,
               October to December 2020, and January to February 2021) and
               across 2 major outbreaks (February to June 2020 and July 2020 to
               February 2021). Results: At data cutoff, 2795 consecutive
               patients were included, with 2634 patients eligible for analysis
               (median [IQR] age, 68 [18-77] years ; 52.8\% men). Eligible
               patients demonstrated significant time-dependent improvement in
               14-day case-fatality rate (CFR) with estimates of 29.8\% (95\%
               CI, 0.26-0.33) for February to March 2020; 20.3\% (95\% CI,
               0.17-0.23) for April to June 2020; 12.5\% (95\% CI, 0.06-22.90)
               for July to September 2020; 17.2\% (95\% CI, 0.15-0.21) for
               October to December 2020; and 14.5\% (95\% CI, 0.09-0.21) for
               January to February 2021 (all P < .001) across the predefined
               phases. Compared with the second major outbreak, patients
               diagnosed in the first outbreak were more likely to be 65 years
               or older (974 of 1626 [60.3\%] vs 564 of 1008 [56.1\%]; P =
               .03), have at least 2 comorbidities (793 of 1626 [48.8\%] vs 427
               of 1008 [42.4\%]; P = .001), and have advanced tumors (708 of
               1626 [46.4\%] vs 536 of 1008 [56.1\%]; P < .001). Complications
               of COVID-19 were more likely to be seen (738 of 1626 [45.4\%] vs
               342 of 1008 [33.9\%]; P < .001) and require hospitalization (969
               of 1626 [59.8\%] vs 418 of 1008 [42.1\%]; P < .001) and
               anti-COVID-19 therapy (1004 of 1626 [61.7\%] vs 501 of 1008
               [49.7\%]; P < .001) during the first major outbreak. The 14-day
               CFRs for the first and second major outbreaks were 25.6\% (95\%
               CI, 0.23-0.28) vs 16.2\% (95\% CI, 0.13-0.19; P < .001),
               respectively. After adjusting for country, sex, age,
               comorbidities, tumor stage and status, anti-COVID-19 and
               anticancer therapy, and COVID-19 complications, patients
               diagnosed in the first outbreak had an increased risk of death
               at 14 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.47-2.32) and 3
               months (HR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.51) compared with those
               diagnosed in the second outbreak. Conclusions and Relevance: The
               findings of this registry-based study suggest that mortality in
               patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 has improved in
               Europe; this improvement may be associated with earlier
               diagnosis, improved management, and dynamic changes in community
               transmission over time.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the
               psychological health status of patients diagnosed with cancer in
               Iraq during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aim was to measure
               the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among patients
               diagnosed with cancer. Secondary aims were to assess the
               association between depression, anxiety, and stress with
               sociodemographic characteristics, cancer-specific
               characteristics, patients' experience in healthcare visit, risk
               perception towards COVID-19, and health concern during the
               outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between
               September 1, 2020 and December 1, 2020 at an Oncology clinic in
               Baghdad. Included in the study were two hundred patients
               diagnosed with cancer. Data collected included: demographic
               variables (age, gender, residential location, marital status,
               education, employment status), clinical characteristics and
               cancer-specific parameters (duration since cancer diagnosis,
               cancer type, treatment duration, clinic visits frequency),
               experience during the pandemic (skipping or postponing treatment
               or periodical tests, suffering from new body pain, fear of
               acquiring the infection, fear of health deterioration), as well
               as psychological health status (depression, anxiety, stress).
               Pain, risk perception towards COVID-19, and health concern were
               measured using categorical Likert scale with responses being no,
               sometimes, and often. The psychological health status was
               measured by the ``Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale''
               (DASS-21). Cut-off scores of the DASS-21 greater than 9, 7, and
               14 represent a positive screen of depression, anxiety, and
               stress, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of patients who
               screened positive for depression was 22.0\%, anxiety 22.0\%, and
               stress 13.5\%. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress
               were significantly more in those who had university or higher
               education (34.3\%, p-value <0.0001; 32.3\%, p-value <0.0001;
               19.2\%, p-value = 0.02 respectively). Those were four times more
               likely to have depression and two times more likely to have
               anxiety than participants who had school education (OR = 4.40 CI
               [1.98-9.77], p-value <0.0001; OR = 2.55 CI [1.15-5.65], p-value
               = 0.02, respectively). The prevalence of anxiety was
               significantly the highest in the age group 16-39 years (40.9\%)
               compared to 22.3\% in the age group 40-64 years and 10.3\% in
               the group $\geq$65 years (p-value = 0.02). Patients $\geq$65
               years of age were less likely to develop anxiety compared to
               younger patients (OR = 0.44 CI [0.22-0.89], p-value = 0.02). As
               for the patients' experience in healthcare visit, 66 patients
               (33.0\%) skipped or postponed their treatment or tests due to
               the outbreak. Around (8\%) sometimes suffered from new body
               pain. Those who sometimes suffered from new body pain had
               significantly more depression than patients who did not suffer
               new pain or often had new pain (50.0\% vs. 15.0\% vs. 28.1\%
               respectively, p-value = 0.002). Those were two times more likely
               to be depressed (OR = 2.18 CI [1.29-3.68], p-value = 0.003).
               Around (50\%) of the patients were often afraid that their
               health would deteriorate during the outbreak. Those were
               significantly more depressed (31.7\%, p-value = 0.002), anxious
               (30.7\%, p-value <0.0001) and stressed (21.8\%, p-value = 0.002)
               than those who did not have fear of losing their health and were
               two times more likely to have anxiety and stress. CONCLUSION:
               These findings, especially the association between developing
               new pain and depression, raised concerns regarding the
               psychological health in patients diagnosed with cancer during
               COVID-19 pandemic. It is crucial to implement psychological
               health screening for patients diagnosed with cancer during the
               pandemic to help prevent any psychological health problems. The
               DASS-21 could be used as a screening tool for distress in these
               patients.",

               management. An increasing number of case reports are found in
               the literature indicating patients admitted in an intensive care
               setting with COVID-19 pneumonitis being complicated with
               invasive fungal infections. In a retrospective assessment of a
               three-month period at the national hospital of Malta, examining
               patients who were suffering from SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory
               distress syndrome, 6 out of 63 patients (9.5\%) were found to
               have confirmation or high probability of invasive fungal
               infection. The consensus definition for invasive fungal disease
               developed by the European Organization for Research and
               Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group Education and
               Research Consortium was utilised to aid in the identification of
               these patients. In total, 15 patients received treatment with an
               anti-fungal agent in this three-month period, the decision being
               led by both clinical suspicion and the use of fungal markers
               obtained from the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage. Although
               several risk factors are attributed for the development of
               invasive fungal disease, the main factors identified in our
               cohort of patients is the SARS-CoV-2 ARDS in itself, along with
               the use of high dose corticosteroids. The average period of time
               between admission in intensive care and diagnosis of invasive
               fungal infection was noted to be 10.5 days. This high incidence
               of invasive fungal disease in mechanically ventilated patients
               suffering from SARS-CoV-2 ARDS, relatively early in their course
               of disease, should guide the clinician to investigate further
               with fungal biomarkers and cultures in those patients who are
               clinically deteriorating despite optimal medical treatment, as
               well as possibly considering empirical anti-fungal treatment if

               disease 2019 (COVID-19) is reverse transcriptase-polymerase
               chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing with nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs.
               The invasiveness and need for trained personnel make the NP
               technique unsuited for repeated community-based mass screening.
               We developed a technique to collect saliva in a simple and easy
               way with the sponges that are usually used for tamponade of
               epistaxis. This study was carried out to validate the clinical
               performance of oral sponge (OS) sampling for severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing.
               Methods: Over a period of 22 weeks, we collected prospectively
               409 paired NP and OS samples from consecutive subjects
               presenting to a public community-based free screening centre.
               Subjects were referred by their attending physician because of
               recent COVID-19 symptoms (n = 147) or by the contact tracing
               staff of the French public health insurance because they were
               considered as close contacts of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
               case (n = 262). Results: In symptomatic subjects, RT-PCR
               SARS-CoV-2 testing with OS showed a 96.5\% (95\% CI: 89.6-94.8)
               concordance with NP testing, and a 93.2\% (95\% CI: 89.1-97.3)
               sensitivity when using the IdyllaTM platform and a sensitivity
               of 76.3\% (95\% CI: 69.4-83.2) on the Synlab Barla laboratory
               platform. In close contacts the NP-OS concordance (93.8\%, 95\%
               CI: 90.9-96.7) and OS sensitivity (71.9\%, 95\% CI: 66.5-77.3)
               were slightly lower. Conclusion: These results strongly suggest
               that OS testing is a straightforward, low-cost and
               high-throughput sampling method that can be used for frequent
               RT-PCR testing of COVID-19 patients and mass screening of

               and NL63 that use ACE2 receptors to infect cells, exhibit
               gastrointestinal symptoms and viral proteins are found in the
               human gastrointestinal tract, yet little is known about the
               inflammatory and pathological effects of coronavirus infection
               on the human intestine. Here, we used a human
               intestine-on-a-chip (Intestine Chip) microfluidic culture device
               lined by patient organoid-derived intestinal epithelium
               interfaced with human vascular endothelium to study host
               cellular and inflammatory responses to infection with NL63
               coronavirus. These organoid-derived intestinal epithelial cells
               dramatically increased their ACE2 protein levels when cultured
               under flow in the presence of peristalsis-like mechanical
               deformations in the Intestine Chips compared to when cultured
               statically as organoids or in Transwell inserts. Infection of
               the intestinal epithelium with NL63 on-chip led to inflammation
               of the endothelium as demonstrated by loss of barrier function,
               increased cytokine production, and recruitment of circulating
               peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Treatment of NL63
               infected chips with the approved protease inhibitor drug,
               nafamostat, inhibited viral entry and resulted in a reduction in
               both viral load and cytokine secretion, whereas remdesivir, one
               of the few drugs approved for COVID19 patients, was not found to
               be effective and it also was toxic to the endothelium. This
               model of intestinal infection was also used to test the effects
               of other drugs that have been proposed for potential repurposing
               against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these data suggest that the
               human Intestine Chip might be useful as a human preclinical
               model for studying coronavirus related pathology as well as for

               clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients hospitalized
               with COVID-19 in Isfahan, Islamic Republic of Iran. Methods:
               This multicentric retrospective observational study was
               performed on all patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Isfahan
               from 17 February to 6 April 2020. We recruited 5055 patients.

               coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer,
               chronic kidney disease (CKD) and chronic respiratory disease
               (CRD) were collected. Statistical analyses were done by
               Mann-Whitney U, $\chi$2 and logistic regression tests using
               Stata version 14. Results: DM and hypertension were the most
               prevalent comorbidities in patients with positive and negative
               reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Odds
               ratio (95\% confidence interval) of mortality-associated factors

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid expansion of
              telehealth use in oncology, a specialty in which prior
              utilization was low in part because of barriers perceived by
              providers. Understanding the changing perceptions of medical
              oncology providers during the pandemic is critical for continued
              expansion and improvement of telehealth in cancer care. This
              study was designed to identify medical oncology providers'
              perceptions of telehealth video visits as influenced by the
              COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured
              interviews with medical oncology providers from November 20,
              2020, to January 27, 2021, at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at
              Thomas Jefferson University, a National Cancer
              Institute-designated cancer center in an urban, academic health
              system in Philadelphia, PA. We assessed provider perceptions of
              the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on (1) provider-level comfort
              and willingness for telehealth, (2) provider-perceived patient
              comfort and willingness to engage in telehealth, and (3)
              continued barriers to successful telehealth use. RESULTS:
              Volunteer and convenience sampling resulted in the participation
              of 25 medical oncology providers, including 18 physicians and
              seven advanced practice providers, in semi-structured interviews.
              Of the 25 participants, 13 (52\%) were female and 19 (76\%) were
              White, with an average age of 48.5 years (standard deviation =
              12.6). Respondents largely stated an increased comfort level and
              willingness for use of video visits. In addition, respondents
              perceived a positive change in patient comfort and willingness,
              mostly driven by convenience, accessibility, and reduced risk of
              COVID-19 exposure. However, several reported technologic issues
              and limited physical examination capability as remaining barriers
              to telehealth adoption. CONCLUSION: The rapid adoption of
              telehealth necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased
              provider-level and provider-perceived patient comfort and
              willingness to engage in video visits for cancer care. As both
              providers and patients increasingly accept telehealth across many
              use cases, future work should focus on further addressing
              technology and physical examination barriers and ensuring
              continued reimbursement for telehealth as a routine part of
              covered care.",

              retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of patients treated
              for oncology disorders of the head and neck in the Otolaryngology
              Unit of the Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome,

              with the same period of the previous year (March 10, 2019 - March
              9, 2020). RESULTS: During the pandemic, we treated 92 patients
              with malignant tumor of the head and neck, compared to 101
              patients treated during the same period of 2019 (-8.91\%). The
              most common anatomical sites of origin of the neoplasms were
              larynx, oral cavity, and oropharynx. Surgical approach was
              preferred in 57 patients (61.95\%); non-surgical treatments were
              performed in 35 cases (38.05\%). Compared to the same period of
              the previous year, we found a 12.90\% decrease in the number of
              oncology patients undergoing surgery, while patients treated
              exclusively with non-surgical approaches increased by 18.42\%.

               questionnaire designed to assess patient satisfaction with
               telemedicine was distributed to all patients who underwent
               surgery at the Providence Breast Centre (PBC) for breast cancer
               or benign/high-risk lesions with surgery follow-up dates between
               October 13 and December 31, 2020. Surveys were conducted via
               phone or at in-person follow-ups. RESULTS: A total of 123 of 172
               (72\%) eligible patients completed the survey; 85\% of these
               patients enjoyed their telemedicine consultation, 93\% found
               there was enough time for dialogue, 66\% would choose to have a
               telemedicine consultation again, 79\% would recommend
               telemedicine at PBC to a friend or family member, and 92\% found
               Zoom\copyright{} easy to use. When asked whether they prefer a
               telemedicine initial consultation over an in-person, 28\% of
               patients agreed. When patients are analyzed according to their
               home address, those more than 10-km away from PBC prefer
               telemedicine over in-person appointments (37\%) more often than
               those who live less than 10-km away (23\%) (p = 0.045).
               CONCLUSIONS: Patients report a high level of satisfaction with
               telemedicine. It may be worthwhile to continue telemedicine
               beyond the pandemic era, due to its convenience, efficiency, and
               low-cost while keeping patients, physicians, and office staff
               safe. It also may be more useful in large geographic areas, such

               coronavirus 2 and the related disorder i.e. ``coronavirus

               the molecular mechanism of disease severity. Several lines of
               evidence support the impact of ``cytokine storm'' in the
               pathogenesis of severe forms of the disorder. We aimed to assess
               expression levels of nine cytokine coding genes in COVID-19
               patients admitted in a hospital. We collected clinical data of
               patients from their medical reports. Then, we assessed
               expression of genes using real-time PCR. Expression levels of
               IFN-G, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, TGF-B, IL-8, and IL-1B were
               significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy
               controls and in both female and male patients compared with
               sex-matched controls. However, expression level of TNF-A was not
               different between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls.
               Expression of none of these cytokines was different between
               ICU-admitted patients and other patients except for IL-6 whose
               expression was lower in the former group compared with the
               latter (ratio of means = 0.33, P value = 4.82E-02). Then, we
               assessed diagnostic power of cytokine coding genes in
               differentiating between COVID-19 patients and controls. The area
               under curve (AUC) values ranged from 0.94 for IFN-G to 1.0 for
               IL-2 and IL-1B. After combining the transcript levels of all
               cytokines, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values reached
               100\%, 100\%, and 99\%, respectively. For differentiation
               between ICU-admitted patients and other patients, IL-4 with AUC
               value of 0.68 had the best diagnostic power among cytokine
               coding genes. Expression of none of cytokine coding genes was

               and distancing as a part of pandemic precautions led to a
               decrease in the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) in
               major oncologic resections. METHODS: Propensity score matching
               using the nearest neighbor algorithm was performed on 3123
               patients over seven covariates (age, comorbidities, surgery
               duration, prior treatment, disease stage, reconstruction, and
               surgical wound type) yielding 2614 matched (pre-COVID 1612 and
               COVID 1002) patients. Conditional logistic regression was used
               to identify if SSI incidence was lower amongst patients operated
               during the pandemic. RESULTS: There was a 4.2\% (p = 0.006)
               decrease in SSI in patients operated during the pandemic. On

               Increased compliance with hand hygiene, near-universal mask
               usage, and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic
               possibly led to a 23\% decreased odds of SSI in major oncologic
               resections. Extending these low-cost interventions in the

               affected patients' death. Furthermore, the resuts of the Cox
               regression showed that the variables of age, level of blood
               oxygen (SpO2), ICU admission,cancer and diabetes were related to
               survival of the patients. It was found that diabetes was
               significantly associated with mortality from COVID-19 with odds
               ratio of 2.88 (95\% CI: 1.80-4.69; P < 0.01) and hazard ratio of
               1.45 (95\% CI: 1.01-2.03; P = 0.05). Conclusion: The underlying
               diabetes significantly increases the mortality among patients
               with Covid-19, so special care should be taken for this high
               risk group if they develop Covid-19.",

               lymphadenopathy on screening mammogram",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination may
               display subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on
               screening mammography, which can appear suspicious for
               malignancy, leading to additional diagnostic evaluation.
               PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical unilateral
               axillary lymphadenopathy (sLAD) on screening mammogram in women
               who received either the first or second dose of the
               Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer) or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines compared
               to women who have not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this
               IRB-approved, HIPAA complaint study from 12/14/2020 to
               4/14/2021, 1027 patients presented for screening mammography and
               met study inclusion criteria. Patients with history of baseline
               lymphadenopathy or prior cancer diagnosis were excluded.
               RESULTS: Of the 1027 women, 43 were recalled for unilateral
               sLAD. 34 women received a COVID-19 vaccination ipsilateral to
               the sLAD (Pfizer n=19, 44.2\%; Moderna n=15, 34.9\%), 9 did not
               (20.9\%). Incidence of unilateral axillary sLAD was
               significantly higher (p-value<0.01) in those who received a
               COVID-19 vaccination within approximately 7 weeks preceding
               screening mammogram. 13.2\% of patients who received the Pfizer
               vaccine and 9.5\% of patients who received the Moderna vaccine
               developed sLAD. Moderna's vaccine elicited a more robust
               reaction in the elderly (Moderna 63.7 years vs. Pfizer 59.7
               years). For both vaccines, sLAD resolved on average 46.5 days
               after the last COVID-19 vaccine (p=0.44). CONCLUSION: Women who
               have received either mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may benefit from
               scheduling their screening mammogram before vaccination or
               consider delaying screening mammography 8 weeks. While Pfizer
               may have an overall more robust immune response, Moderna may
               elicit a stronger immune response in elderly women. SUMMARY:
               Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination before screening
               mammography were significantly more likely to present with
               subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy than women who did not
               receive the vaccine. KEY RESULTS: 13.2\% of women who received a
               Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine exhibited subclinical axillary
               lymphadenopathy compared to 9.5\% of those who received the
               Moderna vaccine. Only 1.2 \% of those who did not receive a
               vaccine presented with subclinical unilateral axillary
               lymphadenopathy. The average time of resolution of the
               lymphadenopathy on diagnostic mammogram was 46.5 days overall,
               with Pfizer-BioNTech taking 50.7 days and Moderna 41.5 days.",

  abstract  = "Purpose of Review: Across the world, medical training has been
               affected by the COVID-19 virus and this has changed the way
               physicians are educated. What is less clear is the effect of the
               pandemic on breast surgical oncology fellows who were in
               training during this time. This review discusses the experience
               of breast surgical oncology fellows during the pandemic and how
               fellowships adapted to preserve the educational experience and
               conserve the quality of training. Recent Findings: The
               challenges and changes experienced by breast surgery fellows
               during the COVID-19 pandemic have proved to be sudden shifts in
               not only fellowship training, but future patient care and
               research opportunities, all while confronting the global impact
               of a deadly pandemic. While experiences between fellowships
               varied, the similarities and differences encountered highlight
               the regional and temporal differences in how fellowships
               responded to the pandemic. Summary: Breast surgical oncology
               fellowship is one year long, with every day allocated to ensure
               the surgeon has a deep understanding of the multidisciplinary
               approach to this ever-evolving field. As the pandemic spread and
               affected different regions with varying severity, elective cases
               were canceled, resources were re-allocated, and uncertainty
               abounded. At the same time, novel approaches to fellowship
               training were rapidly implemented. It will take time and
               additional research to fully understand the long-term
               consequences for trainees affected during their breast surgery

               Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and determine
               their association with lymphocyte counts. Methods: In this
               retrospective single-center study, we included consecutive
               patients who underwent [18F]-FDG PET/CT imaging after mRNA- or
               viral vector-based COVID-19 vaccination between early March and
               late April 2021. Demographic, clinical parameters and absolute
               lymphocyte count (ALC) were collected and their association with
               the presence of v-HLN in the draining territory was studied by
               logistic regression. Results: Two hundred and sixty patients
               were eligible, including 209 (80\%) women and 145 (56\%) with
               breast cancer. The median age was 50 years (range, 23-96). Two
               hundred thirty-three patients (90\%) received the mRNA vaccine.
               Ninety (35\%) patients had v-HLN with a median SUVmax of 3.7
               [range, 2.0-26.3] and 74 (44\%) displayed lymphopenia with a
               median ALC of 1.4 G/L [range, 0.3-18.3]. Age $\leq$ 50 years
               (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95\%CI 1.0-4.5), the absence of
               lymphopenia (OR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.1-4.3) and the delay from the last
               vaccine injection to the date of [18F]-FDG PET/CT, if < 30 days
               (OR 2.6, 95\%CI 1.3-5.6), were independent factors for v-HLN in
               multivariate analysis. In breast cancer patients, the absence of
               lymphopenia was the only independent factor significantly
               associated with v-HLN (OR 2.9, 95\%CI 1.2-7.4). Conclusion:
               Patients with normal values of ALC after COVID-19 vaccine were
               more likely to have v-HLN on [18F]-FDG PET/CT, which might both

               bedside-learning experience compared to traditional Grand-Rounds
               formats. METHODS: From December 2020 to March 2021, the world's
               first two international mixed reality grand rounds events using
               the HoloLens 2 headset were held, broadcasting transatlantically
               (between the University of Michigan and the Imperial College of
               London) bedside rounding experiences on 5 complex surgical
               patients to an international audience of 325 faculty, residents,
               and medical trainees. Participants completed pre- and post-event
               surveys to assess their experience. RESULTS: Of the 325
               participants, 267 (80\%) completed pre-surveys and 95 (29\%)
               completed both the pre- and post-surveys. Respondents [average

               included 92 (34\%) medical students and residents, and 175
               faculty and staff. Pre-event survey: 76\% had little or no
               experience prior with XR devices while 94\% thought
               implementation of XR into medical curricula was valuable. Post
               Survey: 96\% felt tele-rounding using XR technology was
               important for the current era and 99\% thought the ability to
               visualize the exam, imaging, and labs at bedside via XR rounding
               was highly valuable and that this format was superior to

               clinical findings, imaging, and labs at the patient's bedside -
               were superior to a traditional grand rounds format, and that it

               of the pandemic. We aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on
               the practice of GI endoscopy in Asian countries. METHODS: This
               was an International Questionnaire-based Internet Survey
               conducted at multiple facilities by the International
               Gastrointestinal Consensus Symposium. A total of 166 respondents
               in Japan, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand,
               Indonesia, and Singapore participated in this study. RESULTS:
               The volume of endoscopic screening or follow-up endoscopies and
               therapeutic endoscopies were markedly reduced during the first
               wave of the pandemic, which was mainly attributed to the
               decreased number of outpatients, cancellations by patients, and
               adherence to the guidelines of academic societies. The most
               common indications for GI endoscopy during the first wave were
               GI bleeding, cholangitis or obstructive jaundice, and a highly
               suspicious case of neoplasia. The most common GI symptoms of
               COVID-19 patients during the infected period included diarrhea,
               nausea, and vomiting. The pandemic exacerbated some GI diseases,
               such as functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome. There
               were cases with delayed diagnosis of cancers due to postponed
               endoscopic procedures, and the prescription of proton pump
               inhibitors/potassium-competitive acid blockers, steroids,
               immunosuppressive agents, and biologics was delayed or canceled.
               The personal protective equipment used during endoscopic
               procedures for high-risk patients were disposable gloves,
               disposable gowns, N95 or equivalent masks, and face shields.
               However, the devices on the patient side during endoscopic
               procedures included modified surgical masks, mouthpieces with
               filters, and disposable vinyl boxes or aerosol boxes covering
               the head. Furthermore, the time for education, basic research,
               clinical research, and daily clinical practice decreased during
               the first wave. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the
               COVID-19 pandemic profoundly affected the method of performing
               GI endoscopy and medical treatment for patients with GI diseases

               therapy render patients severely immunocompromised for extended
               periods after therapy, and data on responses to COVID-19
               vaccines are limited. We analyzed anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG Ab
               (spike Ab) titers and neutralizing Ab among 217 recipients of
               cellular treatments (allo-HCT, n = 149; auto-HCT, n = 61; CAR
               T-cell therapy, n = 7). At 3 months after vaccination, 188
               patients (87\%) had positive spike Ab levels and 139 (77\%) had
               positive neutralization activity compared with 100\% for both in

               important component of post-cellular therapy care, and

               predictors of response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in
               patients following cellular therapy is critical to managing this
               highly vulnerable patient population. To date, this is the most

               pandemic significantly impacted cancer care. In this study,
               clinical patient characteristics related to COVID-19 outcomes
               and advanced care planning, in terms of non-oncological
               treatment restrictions (e.g. do-not-resuscitate codes), were
               studied in patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: The Dutch
               Oncology COVID-19 Consortium registry was launched in March 2020
               in 45 hospitals in the Netherlands, primarily to identify risk
               factors of a severe COVID-19 outcome in patients with cancer.
               Here, an updated analysis of the registry was performed, and
               treatment restrictions (e.g. do-not-intubate codes) were studied
               in relation to COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer.
               Oncological treatment restrictions were not taken into account.
               RESULTS: Between 27th March 2020 and 4th February 2021, 1360
               patients with cancer and COVID-19 were registered. Follow-up
               data of 830 patients could be validated for this analysis.
               Overall, 230 of 830 (27.7\%) patients died of COVID-19, and 60\%
               of the remaining 600 patients with resolved COVID-19 were
               admitted to the hospital. Patients with haematological
               malignancies or lung cancer had a higher risk of a fatal outcome
               than other solid tumours. No correlation between anticancer
               therapies and the risk of a fatal COVID-19 outcome was found. In
               terms of end-of-life communication, 50\% of all patients had
               restrictions regarding life-prolonging treatment (e.g.
               do-not-intubate codes). Most identified patients with treatment
               restrictions had risk factors associated with fatal COVID-19
               outcome. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of a negative impact
               of anticancer therapies on COVID-19 outcomes. Timely end-of-life
               communication as part of advanced care planning could save
               patients from prolonged suffering and decrease burden in
               intensive care units. Early discussion of treatment restrictions
               should therefore be part of routine oncological care, especially

               restrictions (increasing exposure during pre-epidemic,
               post-lockdown, and lockdown periods) and the recommended

               Adjustments for between-patients unmeasured confounders and
               seasonality of medical services delivering were performed.
               RESULTS: Compared with pre-epidemic, reductions in delivering

               test. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all
               employee attestations and SARS-CoV-2 tests performed between
               March and June 2020. SETTING: A large multi-institutional

               settings. PARTICIPANTS: All employees who worked at the study
               site. METHODS: Data were combined from the attestation system
               (COVIDPass), the employee database, and the electronic health
               records and were analyzed using descriptive statistics including
               $\chi$2, Wilcoxon, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. We investigated

               SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: After data linkage and cleaning, there were
               2,117,298 attestations submitted by 65,422 employees between
               March and June 2020. Most attestations were asymptomatic
               (99.9\%). The most commonly reported symptoms were sore throat
               (n = 910), runny nose (n = 637), and cough (n = 570). Among the
               2,026 employees who ever attested that they were symptomatic,
               905 employees were tested within 14 days of a symptomatic
               attestation, and 114 (13\%) of these tests were positive. The
               most common symptoms associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test
               were anosmia (23\% vs 4\%) and fever (46\% vs 19\%).

               identified a handful of employees with COVID-19. Although the
               number of positive tests was low, attestations may help keep

               group was 65 (P = .68). Most patients (78.6\% and 79.2\%) had
               invasive ductal carcinoma with a clinical tumor size of 0.9 cm
               vs 1.7 cm (P = .056). Time to surgery was 68 days in the
               neoadjuvant endocrine therapy group and 26.5 days in the control
               (P < .001). A total of 23 neoadjuvant endocrine therapy patients
               (82.1\%) had the same or lower pT-stage compared with 31
               (64.5\%) control patients (P = .115). Only 3 (10.7\%)
               neoadjuvant endocrine therapy patients had increased pN-stage vs
               14 (29.2\%) control patients (P = .063). CONCLUSION: Despite
               2.5-times longer delays, patients with early-stage estrogen
               receptor-positive breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant endocrine
               therapy did not experience pathologic upstaging during the
               COVID-19 pandemic. These findings may support the use of
               neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in similar patients if delays to
               surgery are projected.",

               imaging modalities, such as chest radiography (CXR), computed
               tomography (CT), ultrasound, PET/CT scan, and MRI to describe
               the main features for the evaluation of the chest in COVID-19
               patients with ARDS. RECENT FINDINGS: This article includes a
               systematic literature search, evidencing the different chest
               imaging modalities used in patients with ARDS from COVID-19.
               Literature evidences different possible approaches going from
               the conventional CXR and CT to the LUS, MRI, and PET/CT.
               SUMMARY: CT is the technique with higher sensitivity and
               definition for studying chest in COVID-19 patients. LUS or
               bedside CXR are critical in patients requiring close and
               repeated monitoring. Moreover, LUS and CXR reduce the radiation
               burden and the risk of infection compared with CT. PET/CT and
               MRI, especially in ARDS patients, are not usually used for
               diagnostic or follow-up purposes.",

               levels during the current global pandemic, and also other
               respiratory infections, can influence scan interpretation, and
               screening safety and uptake. Several respiratory infections can
               lead to lesions that mimic malignant nodules and other imaging
               changes suggesting malignancy, leading to an increased level of
               follow-up procedures or even invasive diagnostic procedures. In
               periods of increased rates of respiratory infections such as
               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
               there is also a risk of transmission of these infections to the
               health care providers, the screenees and patients. This became
               very clear and evident for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and led to a

               the disease burden and describe the clinical presentation of CAM
               in Germany. METHODS: We identified cases through German mycology
               networks and scientific societies, and collected anonymised
               clinical information via FungiScope\textregistered{}. RESULTS:
               We identified 13 CAM cases from six tertiary referral hospitals
               diagnosed between March 2020 and June 2021. Twelve patients had
               severe or critical COVID-19, eleven were mechanically ventilated
               for a median of 8 days (range 1-27 days) before diagnosis of
               CAM. Eleven patients received systemic corticosteroids.
               Additional underlying medical conditions were reported for all
               but one patient, five were immunocompromised because of
               malignancy or organ transplantation, three were diabetic. Eleven
               patients developed pneumonia. Mortality was 53.8\% with a median
               time from diagnosis of mucormycosis to death of 9 days (range
               0-214 days) despite treatment with liposomal amphotericin B
               and/or isavuconazole in 10 of 13 cases. CAM prevalence amongst
               hospitalised COVID-19 patients overall (0.67\% and 0.58\% in two
               centres) and those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)
               (1.47\%, 1.78\% and 0.15\% in three centres) was significantly
               higher compared to non-COVID-19 patients (P < .001 for
               respective comparisons). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated
               mucormycosis is rare in Germany, mostly reported in patients
               with comorbidities and impaired immune system and severe
               COVID-19 treated in the ICU with high mortality compared to
               mainly rhino-orbito-cerebral CAM in patients with mild COVID-19
               in India. Risk for CAM is higher in hospitalised COVID-19
               patients than in other patients.",

               multicentre, UK-based service evaluation assessed diagnostic
               intervals and disease severity for these conditions. Methods: We
               collected presentation route, timing and disease severity for
               children with newly diagnosed CC in three principal treatment
               centres and T1DM in four centres between 1 January and 31 July
               2020 and the corresponding period in 2019. Total diagnostic
               interval (TDI), patient interval (PI), system interval (SI) and
               disease severity across different time periods were compared.
               Results: For CCs and T1DM, the route to diagnosis and severity
               of illness at presentation were unchanged across all time
               periods. Diagnostic intervals for CCs during lockdown were
               comparable to that in 2019 (TDI 4.6, PI 1.1 and SI 2.1 weeks),
               except for an increased PI in January-March 2020 (median 2.7
               weeks). Diagnostic intervals for T1DM during lockdown were
               similar to that in 2019 (TDI 16 vs 15 and PI 14 vs 14 days),
               except for an increased PI in January-March 2020 (median 21

               associations with COVID-19 severity, cardiorenovascular injury,
               and outcomes. METHODS: This single-center observational study
               enrolled COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support at
               emergency department presentation. >40 markers of alveolar
               (including RAGE), endothelial (including angiopoietin-2), and
               cardiorenovascular injury (including renin, kidney injury
               molecule-1, troponin-I) were serially compared between
               invasively and spontaneously ventilated patients using
               mixed-effects repeated-measures models. Ventilatory ratios were
               calculated for intubated patients. Associations of biomarkers
               with modified World Health Organization scale at Day 28 were
               determined with multivariable proportional-odds regression.
               RESULTS: Of 225 patients, 74 (33\%) received invasive
               ventilation at Day 0. RAGE was 1.81-fold higher in these
               patients at Day 0 (95\%CI: 1.53-2.15) but decreased over time in
               all patients. Changes in alveolar markers did not correlate with
               changes in endothelial, cardiac, or renal injury markers. In
               contrast, endothelial markers were similar-to-lower for invasive
               ventilation at Day 0 but increased over time. In intubated
               patients, angiopoietin-2 was 0.86-fold lower (95\%CI: 0.76-0.96)
               versus non-intubated patients at Day 0 but 1.49-fold higher
               (95\%CI: 1.32-1.67) at Day 3; cardiorenovascular injury markers
               showed similar patterns. Endothelial markers were not
               consistently associated with ventilatory ratios. Endothelial
               markers were more often significantly associated with 28-day
               outcomes than alveolar markers. CONCLUSIONS: Alveolar injury
               markers rise early. Endothelial injury markers rise later and
               are associated with cardiorenovascular injury and 28-day

               preferences of patients, caregivers, and the general public.
               Ongoing and planned health preference research (HPR) has been
               affected due to problems associated with recruitment, data
               collection, and data interpretation. While there are no ``one
               size fits all'' solutions, this commentary summarizes the key
               challenges in HPR within the context of the pandemic and offers
               pragmatic solutions and directions for future research. We
               recommend recruitment of a diverse, typically under-represented
               population in HPR using online, quota-based crowdsourcing
               platforms, and community partnerships. We foresee emerging
               evidence on remote, and telephone-based HPR modes of
               administration, with further studies on the shifts in
               preferences related to health and healthcare services as a
               result of the pandemic. We believe that the recalibration of
               HPR, due to what one would hope is an impermanent change, will
               permanently change how we conduct HPR in the future.",

               patients with hematologic malignancy, who carry high risk for
               severe COVID-19 illness, are incomplete. In a study of 551
               hematologic malignancy patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and
               multiple myeloma, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers and
               neutralizing activity were measured at 1 and 3 months from
               initial vaccination. Compared with healthy controls, patients
               with hematologic malignancy had attenuated antibody titers at 1
               and 3 months. Furthermore, patients with hematologic malignancy
               had markedly diminished neutralizing capacity of 26.3\% at 1
               month and 43.6\% at 3 months, despite positive seroconversion
               rates of 51.5\% and 68.9\% at the respective time points.
               Healthy controls had 93.2\% and 100\% neutralizing capacity at 1
               and 3 months, respectively. Patients with leukemia, lymphoma,
               and multiple myeloma on observation had uniformly blunted
               responses. Treatment with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
               venetoclax, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors,
               anti-CD19/CD20-directed therapies, and anti-CD38/B-cell
               maturation antigen-directed therapies substantially hindered
               responses, but single-agent immunomodulatory agents did not.
               Significance: Patients with hematologic malignancy have
               compromised COVID-19 vaccine responses at baseline that are
               further suppressed by active therapy, with many patients having
               insufficient neutralizing capacity despite positive antibody
               titers. Refining vaccine response parameters is critical to
               guiding clinical care, including the indication for booster

               reported, however data after discharge is limited. The aim was
               to describe ECG abnormalities on admission and following
               recovery of COVID-19, and their associated mortality. Methods:
               All patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital between
               March 7th and July 1st 2020 with COVID-19 were included in a
               retrospective registry. The first ECG on admission was
               collected, together with an ECG after hospital discharge in the
               absence of acute pathology. Automated measures and clinical ECG
               interpretations were collected. Multivariate Cox regression
               analysis was performed to predict 1-year all-cause mortality.
               Results: In total 420 patients were included, of which 83
               patients (19.8\%) died during the 1-year follow-up period.
               Repolarization abnormalities were present in 189 patients
               (45.0\%). The extent of repolarization abnormalities was an
               independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (HR per
               region 1.30, 95\%CI 1.04-1.64) together with age (/year HR 1.06,
               95\%CI 1.04-1.08), heart rate (/bpm HR 1.02, 95\%CI 1.01-1.03),
               neurological disorders (HR 2.41, 95\%CI 1.47-3.93), active
               cancer (HR 2.75, 95\%CI 1.57-4.82), CRP (per 10 mg/L HR 1.05,
               95\%CI 1.02-1.08) and eGFR (per 10 mg/L HR 0.90, 95\%CI
               0.83-0.98).In 245 patients (68.1\%) an ECG post discharge was
               available. New repolarization abnormalities were more frequent
               in patients who died after discharge (4.7\% versus 41.7\%, p <
               0.001) and 8 (3.3\%) had new ventricular conduction defects,
               none of whom died during follow-up. Conclusions: The presence
               and extent of repolarization abnormalities predicted outcome in
               patients with COVID-19. New repolarization abnormalities after
               discharge were associated with post-discharge mortality.",

               overwhelmed most health services. As a result, many surgeries
               have been deferred and diagnoses delayed. The aim of this study
               was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic at a
               high-volume pelvic oncology centre. METHODS: A retrospective
               review was performed of clinical activity from 2017 to 2020. We
               compared caseload for index procedures 2017-2019 (period 1)
               versus 2020 (period 2) to see the effect of the COVID pandemic.
               We then compared the activity during the first lockdown (March
               23rd) to the rest of the year when we increased our theatre
               access by utilising a 'clean' site. RESULTS: The average annual
               number of robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) and robotic
               assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) performed during period 1
               was 82 and 352 respectively. This reduced to 68 (17.1\%
               reduction) and 262 (25.6\% reduction) during period 2. The
               number of patients who underwent prostate brachytherapy
               decreased from 308 to 243 (21\% reduction). The number of
               prostate biopsies decreased from 420 to 234 (44.3\% reduction).
               The number of radical orchidectomies decreased from 18 to 11
               (39\% reduction). The mean number of RARC and RARP per month
               during period 2 was 5.5 and 22. This decreased to 4 and 9 per
               month during the first national lockdown but was maintained
               thereafter despite two further lockdowns. CONCLUSION: There has
               been a substantial decrease in urological oncology caseload
               during the COVID pandemic. The use of alternate pathways such as

               abiraterone/enzalutamide to assess the safety of remote
               monitoring. METHODS: A chart review was conducted on 828
               prostate cancer patients prescribed abiraterone and/or
               enzalutamide. Data were collected to determine time to
               actionable first AEs, including hypertension, elevated liver
               enzymes (aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase
               [ALT]), hyperbilirubinemia, and hypokalemia. Survival analysis
               was used to determine time to AEs. RESULTS: In this study, 425
               and 403 patients received enzalutamide and abiraterone,
               respectively. In total, 25.6\% of those who took enzalutamide
               experienced an AE, compared to 28.8\% of patients on
               abiraterone. For patients using abiraterone and experiencing an
               AE, cumulative incidence of AEs at three, six, nine, and 12
               months were: 67.2\%, 81.9\%, 90.5\%, and 93.9\%, respectively.
               Among enzalutamide users experiencing an AE, cumulative
               incidence of AEs at three, six, nine, and 12 months were 51.4\%,
               70.7\%, 82.6\%, and 88.1\%, respectively. The AEs associated
               with enzalutamide were hypertension and liver dysfunction
               (77.1\% and 22.9\%, respectively). In the abiraterone group,
               associated AEs were liver dysfunction (47.4\%), hypertension

               secondary to abiraterone/enzalutamide decreases over time and
               tends to occur within the first six months of therapy. Most

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In the face of unprecedented challenges because of
               coronavirus disease 2019, interdisciplinary pediatric oncology
               teams have developed strategies to continue providing
               high-quality cancer care. This study explored factors
               contributing to health care resilience as perceived by childhood
               cancer providers in all resource level settings. METHODS: This
               qualitative study consisted of 19 focus groups conducted in 16
               countries in 8 languages. Seven factors have been previously
               defined as important for resilient health care including: 1) in
               situ practical experience, 2) system design, 3) exposure to
               diverse views on the patient's situation, 4) protocols and
               checklists, 5) teamwork, 6) workarounds, and 7) trade-offs.
               Rapid turn-around analysis focused on these factors. RESULTS:
               All factors of health care resilience were relevant to groups
               representing all resource settings. Focus group participants
               emphasized the importance of teamwork and a flexible and
               coordinated approach to care. Participants described
               collaboration within and among institutions, as well as
               partnerships with governmental, private, and nonprofit
               organizations. Hierarchies were advantageous to decision-making
               and information dissemination. Clinicians were inspired by their
               patients and explained creative trade-offs and workarounds used
               to maintain high-quality care. CONCLUSIONS: Factors previously
               described as contributing to resilient health care manifested
               differently in each institution but were described in all
               resource settings. These insights can guide pediatric oncology
               teams worldwide as they provide cancer care during the next
               phases of the pandemic. Understanding these elements of
               resilience will also help providers respond to inevitable future
               stressors on health care systems.",

              lower response rates in haematological malignancies and lower

              efficacy and safety of a heterologous booster vaccination with
              Ad26.COV2.S DNA vector vaccine in haemato-oncological patients
              without antibody response after double-dose BNT162b2 messenger
              (m-)RNA COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 32 haemato-oncological
              non-responders to double-dose BNT162b2 received a heterologous
              booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Blood samples were assessed
              directly before the vaccination (T0) and four weeks after (T1).
              Safety assessment was performed using a standardised
              questionnaire. The overall response rate was 31\%, with a mean
              (SD) antibody titre of 693·79 (1 096·99) binding activity units
              (BAU)/ml. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphoma
              showed a significantly lower response rate (P = 0·048). Adverse
              events were reported in 29·6\% of patients, of which 7·1\% were
              graded as severe, including grade III and IV events following the
              Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE). The
              heterologous booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S led to a
              serological response in nine out of 29 patients without response
              after double-dose BNT162b2. Furthermore, the vaccination was safe
              in our cohort, leading to mainly mild local and systemic
              reactions. Overall, this vaccination regimen should be further
              evaluated to increase the response rate in the highly vulnerable
              population of haemato-oncological patients.",

               corticosteroids (ICS) by asthmatic patients and the severity of
               COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective
               observational study was conducted from March 15 to October 23,
               2020 and included data of all COVID-19 asthmatic patients (n =
               287) at King Abdulaziz Medical City. Twelve patients were
               excluded due to poor medication history documentation or using
               ICS for non-asthma indication. Ordinal logistic regression was
               used to determine the clinical variables that affect COVID-19
               severity. The clinical outcomes of ICS and non-ICS users were
               compared. RESULTS: Of the sample (n = 275), 198 (72\%) were
               using ICS therapy. No significant difference was found between
               ICS and non-ICS users in disease severity (P = 0.12), mortality
               (P = 0.45), ICU admission (P = 0.78), and the occurrence of
               complications. However, the number of days on ventilation were
               significantly increased in ICS users (P = 0.006). Being
               prescribed the ICS/LABA combination (adj OR: 0.72 [0.15,1.2]; P
               = 0.021), being hypertensive (adj OR: 0.98 [0.28,1.6]; P =

               having diabetes (adj OR: 0.75 [0.09, 1.4]; P = 0.024) could not
               increase the risk for more severe disease. CONCLUSION: Overall,
               ICS therapy did not alter the COVID-19 severity or mortality in
               asthmatic patients. The continued use of ICS during the pandemic
               should be encouraged to prevent asthma exacerbations.",

               over the past year, with a shift in focus away from nonurgent
               care. Emerging data are showing that screening for breast and
               colon cancer has dramatically decreased. It is unknown whether
               the same trend has affected patients with melanoma. METHODS:
               This is a retrospective cohort study of melanoma patients at two
               large-volume cancer centers. Patients were compared for 8 months
               before and after the lockdown. Outcomes focused on delay in
               treatment and possible resultant upstaging of melanoma. RESULTS:
               A total of 375 patients were treated pre-lockdown and 313
               patients were treated post-lockdown (17\% decrease). Fewer
               patients presented with in situ disease post-lockdown (15.3\%
               vs. 17.9\%), and a higher proportion presented with stage III-IV
               melanoma (11.2\% vs. 9.9\%). Comparing patients presenting 2
               months before versus 2 months after the lockdown, there was an
               even more significant increase in Stage III-IV melanoma from
               7.1\% to 27.5\% (p < 0.0001). Finally, in Stage IIIB-IIID
               patients, there was a decrease in patients receiving adjuvant
               therapy in the post lockdown period (20.0\% vs. 15.2\%).
               CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the recent pandemic, it appears
               there has been a shift away from melanoma in situ and toward
               more advanced disease, which may have significant downstream
               effects on prognosis and could be due to a delay in screening.
               Significantly patients have presented after the lockdown, and
               fewer patients are undergoing the recommended adjuvant
               therapies. Patient outreach efforts are essential to ensure that
               patients continue to receive preventative medical care and

               disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is concluded that self-limited
               hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine occur possibly owing
               to a substance found in the vaccine vehicle (eg, polyethylene
               glycol). An immune response that is directed against
               human-manufactured spike has to be considered because some of
               the reactions clinically and or histologically closely resemble
               mild COVID-19. Finally, vaccine-associated immune enhancement
               largely attributable to the adjuvant properties of the vaccine
               may unmask certain inflammatory milieus operational in
               psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and subclinical hypersensitivity.",

               controlled by the distinctive selection pressures exerted by
               fluctuating environmental nature and hosts. A total of 410
               whole-genome sequences submitted by the South Asian countries
               were retrieved from the GISAID database and analyzed to assess
               the impact and pattern of mutations in this region. Most common
               and frequent mutations in the South Asian countries are 241C >
               T, 3037C > T, 14408C > T, and 23403A > G and about 85\% SNPs are
               localized in ORF1ab, spike protein, and nucleocapsid. Among the
               identified mutations, the proportion of missense type (54.17\%)
               was highest, followed by the synonymous (41.66\%) and the
               non-coding types (4.17\%). While analyzing transmission source
               in terms of geolocation, the largest clustered group from the
               South Asian countries was based on the G-clade (D614G) (81.7\%;
               335/410 samples), tracing the inception and transmission of
               SARS-CoV-2 infections in the South Asian countries from European
               regions. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the South
               Asian strains are highly related to the South American and

               METHODS: Adult patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms were
               eligible. After the physical examination, both LUS and DUS
               (i.e., diaphragmatic motion and thickness) were performed. All
               patients were followed after 30 days to determine their need for
               ventilation, admission, and/or a new ED evaluation after
               discharge. The diagnostic accuracies of diaphragm measurements
               in assessing the risk of the 30-day outcome were calculated as
               well as the measurements' usefulness. Bland-Altman plots were
               used for comparing bedside and off-line diaphragm measurements.
               RESULTS: 118 patients were enrolled. Median thickness and motion
               were 1.7 mm (iqr 0.4) and 1.8 cm (iqr 0.7), respectively, with a
               mean difference of 0.009 mm (95\% CI -0.037-0.056 mm) and -0.051

               survivorship care, including the widespread use of telehealth.
               Given the swift transition and limited data on preferences and
               experiences around telehealth, we surveyed oncology providers
               and post-treatment survivors to better understand experiences
               with the transition to telehealth. METHODS: We distributed
               provider (MD, PA or NP, nurse, navigator, and social worker) and
               survivor surveys through the American College of Surgeons
               Commission on Cancer in mid-October 2020. Survivor surveys were
               also disseminated through patient advocacy organizations. We
               included questions on demographics, experiences with telehealth,
               and preferences for future telehealth utilization. RESULTS:
               Among N = 607 providers and N = 539 cancer survivors, there was
               overwhelmingly more support from providers than from survivors
               for delivery of various types of survivorship care via
               telehealth and greater comfort with telehealth technologies. The
               only types of appointments deemed appropriate for survivorship
               care by both > 50\% of providers and survivors were discussion
               of laboratory results or imaging, assessment and/or management
               of cancer treatment symptoms, nutrition counseling, and patient
               navigation support. Only a quarter of survivors reported
               increased access to health care services (25.5\%), and 32.0\%
               reported that they would use telehealth again. CONCLUSION:
               Although there have been drastic changes in technological
               capabilities and billing reimbursement structures for
               telehealth, there are still concerns around delivery of a broad
               range of survivorship care services via telehealth, particularly
               from the patient perspective. Still, offering telehealth
               services, where endorsed by providers and if available and
               acceptable to cancer survivors, may provide more efficient and
               accessible care following the COVID-19 pandemic.",

               methodology including risk of bias assessment and grading of the
               quality of evidence. Only prospective clinical trials randomly
               assigning COVID-19 patients to convalescent plasma plus standard
               of care therapy (test arm) versus placebo/standard of care
               (control arm) were included. Two reviewers independently read
               each preprint/publication and extracted relevant data from

               model and expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95\% confidence
               interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 13 206 patients from 12
               randomised controlled trials were included. There was no
               significant difference in clinical improvement rate (RR = 1.00,

               placebo/standard of care therapy. The use of convalescent plasma
               was not associated with significantly reduced risk of death (RR
               = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.65-1.02, p = 0.08). Reassuringly, overall
               incidence of infusion-related serious adverse events was low

               investigate these time trends in an extremely large
               international cohort of 142,540 patients hospitalised with
               COVID-19. Investigated are: time from symptom onset to hospital
               admission, probability of ICU/HDU admission, time from hospital
               admission to ICU/HDU admission, hospital case fatality ratio
               (hCFR) and total length of hospital stay. Results: Time from
               onset to admission showed a rapid decline during the first
               months of the pandemic followed by peaks during August/September
               and December 2020. ICU/HDU admission was more frequent from June
               to August. The hCFR was lowest from June to August. Raw numbers
               for overall hospital stay showed little variation, but there is
               clear decline in time to discharge for ICU/HDU survivors.
               Conclusions: Our results establish that variables of these kinds
               have limitations when used as outcome measures in a
               rapidly-evolving situation. Funding: This work was supported by

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: To assess the patient experience of Remote Clinical
               Consultations (RCCs) for head and neck cancer and cleft lip and
               palate patients undergoing specialist restorative dentistry
               treatment in the context of a secondary care service. METHODS:
               An online survey was designed; all ninety three patients were
               invited to participate in its completion following a video or
               telephone remote clinical consultation with one restorative
               consultant in * (Name of hospital removed) between August 2020
               and April 2021. The video consultations were carried out via NHS
               England's Attend Anywhere platform. RESULTS: Sixty three
               responses were received. Over 70\% of patients valued a video or
               telephone remote clinical consultation rather than an in-person
               attendance. Patients reported a good experience and would
               recommend a remote clinical consultation instead of an in-person
               attendance if no treatment would likely be required. Those who
               were less likely to recommend a remote clinical consultation
               were those who had difficulties logging-in to the remote
               platform or had technical issues. CONCLUSION: While a number of
               patients still would have preferred a face-to-face attendance,
               both telephone and video remote consultations were highly valued
               by patients, and the overall patient experience was that of
               acceptance. Benefits of remote consultations perceived by
               patients included having set time to discuss concerns and
               queries, becoming familiar with a clinician prior to any
               treatment, saving time, minimising travel and reducing expenses.
               Barriers to a positive experience included technical
               difficulties. This survey contributes to the evidence supporting
               remote clinical consultations as a practical way of delivering
               specialist consultations in restorative dentistry, it highlights
               this virtual process largely relates to the practicalities of
               service provision and highlights the use of remote consultations
               for specific appointments. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study
               demonstrates patient feedback to a strategy implemented due to
               adaptations in working methods required as result of the
               Covid-19 pandemic. Patients were found to have a positive,
               accepting experience of both telephone and video remote clinical
               consultations. the study identifies a high patient acceptability
               and ability to overcome some of the disadvantages of an
               in-person attendance including saving time, travel and
               associated expenses while also contributing to a reduction in
               CO2 emissions and potentially improving clinical efficiency and
               capacity. These findings add to existing evidence and are
               indicative that remote consultations provide a practical way of
               delivering specialist communication in restorative dentistry as
               part of a unique patient pathway.",

               anti-inflammatory effects in both animal models and early human
               trials of COVID-19-related pneumonia. The role of whole-lung
               LD-RT within existing treatment paradigms merits further study.
               METHODS: A phase II prospective trial studied the addition of
               LD-RT to standard drug treatments. Hospitalized and
               oxygen-dependent patients receiving dexamethasone and/or
               remdesevir were treated with 1.5 Gy whole-lung LD-RT and
               compared to a blindly-matched contemporaneous control cohort.
               RESULTS: Of 40 patients evaluated, 20 received drug therapy
               combined with whole-lung LD-RT and 20 without LD-RT. Intubation
               rates were 14\% with LD-RT compared to 32\% without (p = 0.09).
               Intubation-free survival was 77\% vs. 68\% (p = 0.17).
               Biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, p = 0.02) and
               cardiac injury (creatine kinase, p < 0.01) declined following
               LD-RT compared to controls. Mean time febrile was 1.4 vs 3.3
               days, respectively (p = 0.14). Significant differences in
               clinical recovery (7.5 vs. 7 days, p = 0.37) and radiographic
               improvement (p = 0.72) were not detected. On subset analysis,
               CRP decline following LD-RT was predictive of recovery without
               intubation compared to controls (0\% vs. 31\%, p = 0.04),
               freedom from prolonged hospitalizations (21+ days) (0\% vs.
               31\%, p = 0.04), and decline in oxygenation burden (56\%
               reduction, p = 0.06). CRP decline following 1st drug therapy was
               not similarly predictive of outcome in controls (p = 0.36).

               biomarkers of inflammation and cardiac injury in COVID-19
               patients and may have reduced intubation. Durable CRP decline

               at investigating the utility of the C-reactive protein to
               albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio for early risk stratification of
               patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 557 patients with
               COVID-19 with confirmed outcomes (discharged or deceased)
               admitted to the West Court of Union Hospital, Wuhan, China,
               between January 29, 2020 and April 8, 2020. Patients with severe
               COVID-19 (n = 465) were divided into stable (n = 409) and
               progressive (n = 56) groups according to whether they progressed
               to critical illness or death during hospitalization. To predict
               disease progression, the CRP/Alb ratio was evaluated on
               admission. Results: The levels of new biomarkers, including
               neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio,
               CRP/Alb ratio, and systemic immune-inflammation index, were
               higher in patients with progressive disease than in those with
               stable disease. Correlation analysis showed that the CRP/Alb
               ratio had the strongest positive correlation with the sequential
               organ failure assessment score and length of hospital stay in
               survivors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that
               percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2), D-dimer levels, and the
               CRP/Alb ratio were risk factors for disease progression. To
               predict clinical progression, the areas under the receiver
               operating characteristic curves of Alb, CRP, CRP/Alb ratio,
               SpO2, and D-dimer were 0.769, 0.838, 0.866, 0.107, and 0.748,
               respectively. Moreover, patients with a high CRP/Alb ratio
               ($\geq$1.843) had a markedly higher rate of clinical
               deterioration (log - rank p < 0.001). A higher CRP/Alb ratio
               ($\geq$1.843) was also closely associated with higher rates of
               hospital mortality, ICU admission, invasive mechanical
               ventilation, and a longer hospital stay. Conclusion: The CRP/Alb
               ratio can predict the risk of progression to critical disease or
               death early, providing a promising prognostic biomarker for risk
               stratification and clinical management of patients with severe

  abstract  = "Background: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit New
               South Wales (NSW) Australia in early 2020, followed by a sharp
               state-wide lockdown from mid-March to mid-May. After the
               lockdown, there had been a low level of community transmission
               of COVID-19 over a year. Such pandemic experiences provide
               unique opportunity to understand the impact of the pandemic on
               paediatric health service use as countries emerge from the
               pandemic. Methods: We examined the difference between the
               observed and the predicted numbers of inpatient admissions and
               emergency department (ED) attendances, respectively, related to
               chronic, acute infectious and injury conditions, for each month
               during the COVID-19 period (January 2020-February 2021), based
               on the numbers from 2016 to 2019, using records from two major
               paediatric hospitals in NSW. All analyses were conducted using
               autoregressive error models and were stratified by patient age,
               sex and socioeconomic status. Findings: Health service use was
               significantly lower than predicted for admissions and/or ED
               attendances related to chronic conditions, acute infections, and
               injury during the lockdown in 2020. Change in health service use
               varied by chronic conditions, from the largest decrease for
               respiratory conditions (40-78\%) to non-significant change for
               cancer and mental health disorders. After the lockdown, health
               service use for most health conditions returned to pre-COVID-19
               predicted levels. However, for mental health disorders,
               increased health service use persisted from June 2020 up to
               February 2021 by 30-55\%, with higher increase among girls aged
               12-17 years and those from socioeconomically advantaged areas.
               There was persistently lower health service use for acute
               infections and increased health service use for injuries.
               Differences by socio-demographic factors were noted for mental
               health disorders and injuries. Interpretation: The immediate
               return to pre-COVID-19 levels for most chronic conditions after
               the first lockdown in NSW highlights the healthcare needs for
               children affected by chronic conditions. Persistently lower
               health service use for acute infections is likely attributable
               to the decreased social contact. Sustained and targeted mental
               health support is essential to address the potentially increased
               demand for services among children during and beyond the
               pandemic. Funding: Financial Markets Foundation for Children

               and June 2020 across 14 facilities affiliated with the Kanagawa
               General Thoracic Surgery Study Group. RESULTS: The average
               number of newly referred patients from February to June 2020 was
               65\% of that during the same period in 2019. Six facilities
               placed restrictions on medical care services, among which four
               restricted surgeries. At all institutions and those placed on
               surgical restriction, the total number of surgeries under
               general anesthesia was 92\% and 78\%, the total number of
               primary lung cancers was 94\% and 86\%, and the total number of

               identified. The estimated overall HHC was 74\%, which was higher
               than that reported in previous studies (5\%-89\%). Fever clinic
               has become a new key place for HHC observation. Nurses had the
               highest HHC (80\%; 95\% CI:74\%-87\%) while auxiliary workers
               (70\%; 95\%CI:62\%-77\%) had the lowest. For the WHO
               five-moments, the healthcare providers had the highest HHC after
               contact with the body fluids of the patients (91\%; 95\%
               CI:88\%-94\%), while before contact with patients healthcare
               providers had the lowest HHC (68\%; 95\% CI:62\%-74\%) which was
               consistent with before the pandemic. There existed great HHC
               differences among different monitoring methods (automatic
               monitoring system:53\%; 95\% CI:44\%-63\% vs openly and secretly
               observation: 91\%; 95\% CI: 90\%-91\%). CONCLUSIONS: During the
               COVID-19 pandemic, the compliance of healthcare providers' HH
               showed a great improvement. The fever clinics have become the
               focused departments for HH monitoring. The HHC of auxiliary
               workers and the HH opportunity for ``before contact with
               patients'' should be strengthened. In the future, it will be
               necessary to develop standardized HH monitoring tools for
               practical work.",

               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
               ASCO's COVID-19 registry promotes systematic data collection
               across US oncology practices. METHODS: Participating practices
               enter data on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer
               treatment. In this analysis, we focus on all patients with
               hematologic or regional or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.
               Primary outcomes are 30- and 90-day mortality rates and change
               over time. RESULTS: Thirty-eight practices provided data for 453
               patients from April to October 2020. Sixty-two percent had
               regional or metastatic solid tumors. Median age was 64 years.
               Forty-three percent were current or previous cigarette users.
               Patients with B-cell malignancies age 61-70 years had twice
               mortality risk (hazard ratio = 2.1 [95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.3]) and
               those age > 70 years had 4.5 times mortality risk (95\% CI, 1.8
               to 11.1) compared with patients age $\leq$ 60 years. Association
               between survival and age was not significant in patients with
               metastatic solid tumors (P = .12). Tobacco users had 30-day
               mortality estimate of 21\% compared with 11\% for never users
               (log-rank P = .005). Patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 before
               June 2020 had 30-day mortality rate of 20\% (95\% CI, 14\% to
               25\%) compared with 13\% (8\% to 18\%) for those diagnosed in or
               after June 2020 (P = .08). The 90-day mortality rate for
               pre-June patients was 28\% (21\% to 34\%) compared with 21\%
               (13\% to 28\%; P = .20). CONCLUSION: Older patients with B-cell
               malignancies were at increased risk for death (unlike older
               patients with metastatic solid tumors), as were all patients
               with cancer who smoke tobacco. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 later in
               2020 was associated with more favorable 30- and 90-day
               mortality, likely related to more asymptomatic cases and

               prostate cancer. The ideal procedure would be one that offers
               fast and efficient results safely as an outpatient procedure.
               Historically, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy is considered
               the gold standard but transrectal biopsy can under-sample the
               anterior and apical regions of the prostate and is associated
               with a risk of prostate biopsy-related sepsis, which may require
               intensive care admission. Transperineal (TP) biopsy addresses
               the inefficient sampling of TRUS biopsy but historically has
               been done under general anaesthetic, which makes it difficult to
               incorporate into timed diagnostic pathways such as the National
               Health Service (NHS) 2-week cancer pathway. TRUS biopsy has
               remained the mainstay of clinical diagnosis because of its
               simplicity; however, the recent development of simpler local
               anaesthetic transperineal techniques has transformed outpatient
               biopsy practice. These techniques practically eliminate prostate
               biopsy-related sepsis, have a shallow learning curve and offer
               effective sampling of all areas of the prostate in an outpatient
               setting. The effectiveness of TP biopsy has been enhanced by the
               introduction of multiparametric MRI prior to biopsy, the use of
               PSA density for risk stratification in equivocal cases and
               combined with more efficient targeted and systematic biopsies
               techniques, such as the Ginsburg Protocol, has improved the
               tolerability and diagnostic yield of local anaesthetic TP
               biopsies, reducing the risk of complications from the
               oversampling associated with transperineal template mapping
               biopsies. Areas where the literature remains unclear is the
               optimum number of cores needed to detect clinically significant
               disease (CSD) in patients with a definable lesion on MRI, in
               particular, whether there is a need for systematic biopsy in the
               face of equivocal MRI findings to ensure no CSD is missed. The
               Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on prostate cancer
               referrals and prostate biopsy techniques within the UK; prior to
               the pandemic 65\% of all prostate biopsies were TRUS, since the
               pandemic the proportions have reversed such that now over 65\%
               of all prostate biopsies in the NHS are transperineal.",

               asynchronous model of review of medical records followed by a
               detailed assessment of past and current management along with
               discussion of potential future options in a report sent to the
               local oncologist. This summary describes an early period of
               development and growth of this service, focusing on cases of
               lung cancer, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS:
               Cases were primarily identified by a trigger list of cancer
               diagnoses that included non-small-cell lung cancer and
               small-cell lung cancer. After medical records were obtained, a
               summary narrative was provided to a thoracic oncology specialist
               who wrote a case review sent to the local physician, followed by
               a direct discussion with the recipient. We focused on
               feasibility as measured by case volumes, the rates of
               concordance between the subspecialist reviewer with the local
               team, and cost savings from recommended changes, using
               descriptive statistics. RESULTS: From April 2019 to November
               2020, 110 cases were reviewed: 55\% male, median age 62.5 years
               (range, 33-92 years); 82\% non-small-cell lung cancer (12\%
               stage I or II, 16\% stage III, and 57\% stage IV), and 17\%
               small-cell lung cancer (4\% limited and 14\% extensive). Median
               turnaround time for report send-out was 5.0 days. The review
               agreed with local management in 79 (72\%) cases and disagreed in
               31 (28\%) cases; notably, specific additional recommendations
               were associated with evidence-based anticipated improvements in
               efficacy in 76 cases (69\%) and improvement in potential for
               cure in 14 cases (13\%). Recommendations leading to cost savings
               were identified in 14 cases (13\%), translating to a projected
               cost savings of \$19,062 (USD) per patient for the entire cohort

               feasibility of completing a rapid turnaround of cases of lung
               cancer either patient-initiated for review or prospectively
               triggered by diagnosis and stage. This program of asynchronous

               as an important target for antiviral drug development. However,
               how its activity is regulated intracellularly is still obscure.
               In this study, we developed a 3CLpro protease activity reporter
               system to examine the impact of various factors, including
               nutrient supplements, ions, pHs, or oxidative stress inducers,
               on 3CLpro protease activity. We found that oxidative stress
               could increase the overall activity of 3CLpro. Not altering the
               expression, oxidative stress decreased the solubility of 3CLpro
               in the lysis buffer containing 1\% Triton-X-100. The
               Triton-X-100-insoluble 3CLpro was correlated with aggregates'
               formation and responsible for the increased enzymatic activity.
               The disulfide bonds formed between Cys85 sites of 3CLpro
               protomers account for the insolubility and the aggregation of
               3CLpro. Besides being regulated by oxidative stress, 3CLpro
               impaired the cellular antioxidant capacity by regulating the
               cleavage of GPx1 at its N-terminus. This cleavage could further
               elevate the 3CLpro-proximate oxidative activity, favor
               aggregation and activation of 3CLpro, and thus lead to a
               positive feedback loop. In summary, we reported that oxidative
               stress transforms 3CLpro into a detergent-insoluble form that is
               more enzymatically active, leading to increased viral
               replication/transcription. Our study provided mechanistic
               evidence that suggests the therapeutic potential of antioxidants

               COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. A ``shelter in place'' mandate
               was issued in March 2020. The effect on vulnerable populations
               of adolescent and young adult females has not been well
               documented. METHODS: We administered a monthly online survey
               between May and November 2020 to adolescent and young adult
               females participating in a longitudinal study at Mount Sinai
               Adolescent Health Center. Surveys asked about death of loved
               ones, financial impacts, social interactions, exposure to
               dangerous situations, and mental health impacts. Differences in
               responses by age, race/ethnicity, and living situation were
               assessed, and compared to data obtained on the same cohort prior
               to the pandemic. RESULTS: Four hundred seventeen females aged
               15-28 years completed at least one survey, 94\% of whom were
               youth of color. A third of responders (33\%) had lost relatives
               or other people they were close to (loved ones). Most (68\%)
               reported one or more financial losses, and 21\% reported food
               insecurity, with those not living with parents or a guardian
               experiencing significantly higher rates. One in 10 reported
               experiencing sexual abuse or interpersonal partner violence
               during the ``shelter in place'' period. Over a third (37\%)
               reported symptoms of clinical depression, which represented a
               significant increase compared to before the pandemic (p = .01).
               The negative financial impacts and higher proportion of patients
               with depressive symptomatology remained elevated for adolescents
               without support at home. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had
               unprecedented negative short-term financial and psychosocial

               have focused on those working in pediatrics and its
               subspecialties, as well as ancillary and non-patient-facing

               providers and staff. METHODS: An anonymous electronic survey was
               developed evaluating demographics, pandemic experiences,
               possible predictor variables, and three main outcomes of
               burnout, psychological distress, and perceived stress. Pediatric
               hematology oncology (PHO) chiefs and program directors across
               the country were invited to participate and disseminate the
               survey to their programs. RESULTS: A total of 682/1950 (35\% of
               invited) individuals responded to all predictor and outcome
               variables. Over half reported high levels of burnout and some
               reported moderate/high levels of distress. Prepandemic burnout
               and decreased trust in leadership were associated with all three
               outcomes. Additional predictors included having a child $\leq$18
               years at home, hospital role, and worrying about patient care or
               relationship with their patients. The majority (n = 444/682,
               65.5\%) reported that their institution had made
               COVID-19-related mental health resources available. However,
               only 6.5\% (n = 44/682) reported utilizing these resources.
               CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of PHO providers and staff were
               resilient during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, many
               reported high levels of burnout, yet few are utilizing
               institutional resources. This study has highlighted several

               rapid implementation of an exercise-based telerehabilitation
               program in response to COVID-19, a process evaluation was
               conducted to understand the impact on patients, staff and the
               health service with the aim of informing future program
               development. METHODS: A mixed methods evaluation of a
               telerehabilitation program for cancer survivors admitted between
               March and December 2020. Interviews were conducted with patients
               and staff involved in implementation. Routinely collected
               hospital data (adverse events, referral, admissions, wait-time,
               attendance, physical activity and quality of life) were also
               assessed. Patients received an 8-week telerehabilitation
               intervention including one-on-one health coaching via
               telehealth, online group exercise and education, information
               portal and home exercise prescription. Quantitative data were
               reported descriptively, and qualitative interview data coded and
               mapped to the Proctor Model for Implementation Research.
               RESULTS: The telerehabilitation program received 175 new
               referrals over 8-months. Of those eligible, 123/150 (82\%)
               commenced. There were no major adverse events. Adherence to
               health coaching was high (80\% scheduled sessions), but
               participation in online group exercise classes was low (n=36,
               29\%). Patients improved their self-reported physical activity
               levels (+110 minutes per week, IQR 90 to 401) by program
               completion. Patients were satisfied with telerehabilitation, but
               clinicians reported a mixed experience of pride in rapid care
               delivery contrasting with loss of personal connections. The
               average health service cost per patient was AUD \$1,104.

               at a cancer genetic counseling clinic throughout the first 6
               months of the pandemic (March-August 2020). METHODS: An
               anonymous survey assessed patient demographics; usage and prior
               experience with technology; emotional responses, technical
               experiences, and satisfaction with the telehealth appointment
               (via the Genetic Counseling Satisfaction Scale and

               future telehealth; and recommendation of telehealth to others.
               RESULTS: Among 380 respondents, most were highly satisfied with
               the telehealth appointment (with 65.6\% and 66.4\% of

               less education felt significantly more concerned about
               telehealth than those with highest educational attainment.
               Participants age 40-69 years were generally more comfortable,
               relieved, and grateful that their appointment was scheduled as
               telehealth than were those older than 70 years. Women were
               marginally more relieved and grateful for telehealth
               appointments than men. As the pandemic progressed, significantly
               more participants were highly satisfied with their telehealth
               appointment and participants trended toward having greater
               preferences for future telehealth use. Most participants

               anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies may have worse coronavirus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes due to impaired humoral
               immunity, but differences compared with the general population
               are unknown. METHODS: We identified patients with
               immune-mediated diseases who received anti-CD20 monoclonal
               antibodies within 1 year prior to the index date of polymerase
               chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 between January 31, 2020, and
               January 31, 2021. General population comparators with COVID-19
               were matched up 5:1 by age, sex, and polymerase chain reaction
               date. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted (for age, race, body
               mass index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index) hazard ratios (HRs)

               Cox regression. RESULTS: We identified 114 cases patients
               COVID-19 who had received anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for
               immune-mediated diseases (mean age 55 years, 70\% female) and
               559 matched comparators with COVID-19 (mean age 54 years, 70\%
               female). Patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies
               had higher mortality (adjusted HR 2.16; 95\% CI: 1.03-4.54) than
               matched comparators. Risks of hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.88;
               95\% CI: 0.62-1.26) and mechanical ventilation use (adjusted HR
               0.82; 95\% CI: 0.36-1.87) were similar. Similar trends were seen
               in analyses according to type of indication (eg, rheumatic or

  abstract  = "AIMS: Thousands of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers every
               year might be prevented through increased receipt of vaccination
               against the human papillomavirus (HPV). This project aimed to
               (1) increase the rate of HPV vaccination status assessment, and
               (2) improve HPV vaccine initiation and completion rates among 18
               to 26-year-old patients in the family practice setting. DESIGN:
               Quality improvement project, pre/post intervention design.
               METHODS: This project implemented the HIYA! (HPV Immunization
               among Young Adults) Intervention in a private sports and family
               practice in central New Jersey. HIYA! implemented 10 pre-,
               during, and post-visit outcome measures during every family
               medicine visit with an 18 to 26-year-old patient for HPV. Data
               collection involved retrospective chart review of every eligible
               patient during the 12-week implementation period from 17 August
               to 06 November 2020 and during the same 12-week control period
               in 2019. RESULTS/FINDINGS: One hundred sixteen charts from 2019
               and 129 charts from 2020 were reviewed for assessment of HPV
               vaccination status and HPV vaccine initiation and/or completion.
               Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that
               participants in the control group were 84\% less likely to be
               assessed for HPV vaccination status and were 91\% less likely to
               initiate and complete HPV vaccination compared with the
               intervention group. CONCLUSION: This QI project found HIYA! to
               be an effective and feasible strategy to improve HPV vaccination
               rates among 18 to 26-year-old patients in a family practice
               setting. IMPACT: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most
               common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and
               causes thousands of cancers annually. Although vaccination
               against HPV can prevent these cancers, vaccination rates remain
               low, particularly among young adults ages 18 to 26 years. The
               positive impact of HIYA! was evident based on its success
               despite the unique challenges presented during the
               implementation period due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

               is ranked the 18th most common male cancer in Malaysia with
               seminoma representing 40\% of the primary testicular neoplasms.
               Early detection of the tumour and the immediate initiation of
               treatment and disease management provide high possibilities of
               positive outcomes for patients. Case presentation: A 36-year-old
               male was initially diagnosed with a left cryptorchidism and
               metastatic testicular seminoma. However, due to socioeconomic
               circumstances and the Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, he
               defaulted on his chemoradiotherapy follow-up treatments. He
               returned to us four years later with a progressively enlarging
               testicular mass with normal tumour marker values and
               subsequently underwent a successful radical left orchidectomy.
               Histopathological examination revealed features of regressed
               germ cell tumour (GCT). He successfully underwent
               chemoradiotherapy treatment and surveillance follow-ups did not
               show tumor recurrences. Discussion: Seminoma is the commonest
               type of testicular carcinoma with good prognosis among young
               patients. In huge masses, as seen in our patient, early
               chemoradiotherapy with the intention to reduce tumor bulk and
               invasiveness after which will be followed by radical
               orchidectomy. Residual mass post chemotherapy for patients with
               seminomas should be properly assessed for viability of tumor
               cells within it. Conclusion: Undescended testis and
               cryptorchidism present key risk factors for developing
               testicular carcinomas which are uncommon among men. Early
               detection, surgery and chemoradiotherapy on seminomas would
               usually lead to positive outcomes. The remarkable
               chemosensitivity of a seminomatous type tumour towards a

               of surgery compared to primary endocrine therapy (PET) in
               patients with non-advanced, operable invasive breast cancer, and
               to determine if PET as initial therapy may safely postpone
               surgery. METHODS: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane
               Library were searched from database inception to July 2020 to
               identify eligible studies. Inclusion criteria were experimental
               or observational studies with at least one arm treated with PET
               and a second arm treated with surgery with or without PET. Local
               recurrence or progression of disease was defined as either
               failure of non-operative management (tumor failing to decrease
               in size and/or continuous local or distant tumor growth) or
               relapse of breast tumor after tumor downsizing following PET.
               Effect estimates were expressed in hazard ratio and 95\%
               confidence intervals (HR (95\% CI)). RESULTS: The analysis
               included six studies with 1499 unique patients. The median time
               to local progression of disease was 2.3 years. Patients treated
               with PET alone without surgery had a higher risk of local
               recurrence and or progression [HR (95\% CI): 1.76 (1.33, 2.31);
               I2 = 84\%; p < 0.001]. Patients treated with PET had more
               favorable outcomes in terms of overall survival [HR (95\% CI):
               1.24 (1.06, 1.46); I2 = 70\%; p = 0.008] and less favorable
               outcomes in breast cancer-specific survival [HR (95\% CI): 1.13
               (0.98, 1.31); I2 = 41\%; p = 0.10]. The risk of publication bias
               was assessed to be high in reporting local recurrence rates and
               low in reporting distant recurrence rates. CONCLUSION: PET alone
               is inferior to surgery in the treatment of operable invasive
               breast cancer. However, it may be acceptable to postpone
               curative breast cancer surgery without risk of progression for
               1.1 years or longer.",

               appointments (88.9 vs 70.2\%, p = 0.02) or from rural counties
               (88.7\% vs 69.6\%, p = 0.03) were interested in telemedicine;
               those with both characteristics reported 100\% interest. The
               majority in both urban and rural counties had home internet
               access, and reported similarly high rates of daily use (79\% vs
               75\%). Race and age were not associated with differences in
               internet access or use or telemedicine interest. Conclusions:
               Telemedicine is attractive to the majority of patients and may
               offer financial/logistical advantages. Patients have high
               internet use rates and comfort with using technology for
               healthcare. Telemedicine should be incorporated into standard

               was analysed as main secondary endpoint until day 28 and in the

               transformation of the overall healthcare approach to benefit the
               patient and society at large. To this end, specific biomarker
               panels are instrumental for a cost-effective predictive approach
               of individualized prevention and treatments tailored to the
               person. The source of biomarkers is crucial for specificity and
               reliability of diagnostic tests and treatment targets.
               Furthermore, any diagnostic approach preferentially should be
               noninvasive to increase availability of the biomaterial, and to
               decrease risks of potential complications as well as concomitant
               costs. These requirements are clearly fulfilled by tear fluid,
               which represents a precious source of biomarker panels. The
               well-justified principle of a ``sick eye in a sick body'' makes
               comprehensive tear fluid biomarker profiling highly relevant not
               only for diagnostics of eye pathologies but also for prediction,

               severe complications that include dry eye, neurologic, and
               oncologic diseases. In this review, protein profiles in tear

               exemplified for several relevant pathologies, including dry eye
               disease, diabetic retinopathy, cancers, and neurological

               disease (CKD), obesity, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative
               diseases has been reported among patients with diabetes.
               Metformin is the oldest oral antidiabetic drug and can improve
               coexisting complications of diabetes. Clinical trials and
               observational studies uncovered that metformin can remarkably
               prevent or alleviate cardiovascular diseases, obesity,
               polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), osteoporosis, cancer,

               and COVID-19. In addition, metformin has been proposed as an
               antiaging agent. Numerous mechanisms were shown to be involved
               in the protective effects of metformin. Metformin activates the
               LKB1/AMPK pathway to interact with several intracellular
               signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms. The drug modifies
               the biologic function of NF-$\kappa$B, PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
               SIRT1/PGC-1$\alpha$, NLRP3, ERK, P38 MAPK, Wnt/$\beta$-catenin,
               Nrf2, JNK, and other major molecules in the intracellular
               signaling network. It also regulates the expression of noncoding
               RNAs. Thereby, metformin can regulate metabolism, growth,
               proliferation, inflammation, tumorigenesis, and senescence.
               Additionally, metformin modulates immune response, autophagy,
               mitophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis and
               exerts epigenetic effects. Furthermore, metformin protects
               against oxidative stress and genomic instability, preserves
               telomere length, and prevents stem cell exhaustion. In this
               review, the protective effects of metformin on each disease will
               be discussed using the results of recent meta-analyses, clinical
               trials, and observational studies. Thereafter, it will be

               event known as ``cytokine storm'', which is associated with
               severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and high
               mortality. The excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines
               is linked, inter alia, to the enhanced activity of receptors
               capable of recognizing the conservative regions of pathogens and
               cell debris, namely TLRs, TREM-1 and TNFR1. Here we report that
               peptides derived from innate immunity protein Tag7 inhibit
               activation of TREM-1 and TNFR1 receptors during acute

               METHODS: We identified 3,962 men with intermediate/high-risk
               disease from the SEARCH cohort treated with radical
               prostatectomy (RP) from 1988 to 2018. Cox proportional hazard
               models assessed the association between time from biopsy to RP
               (up to 1 year) and time to castration-resistant PC (CRPC),
               metastasis and all-cause mortality. Interaction terms were used
               to test for effect modification by risk group. RESULTS: Of the
               3,962 men, 167 developed CRPC, 248 developed metastases and 884
               died after a median followup of 85 months. Longer delays between
               biopsy and RP were associated with a decreased risk of CRPC
               (adjusted HR=0.88, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.98, p=0.02), independent of
               D'Amico risk group (interaction p >0.05). In men with
               intermediate and high-risk disease, we found no statistically
               significant association between length of time to RP and risk of
               developing metastases (p=0.5 and 0.9, respectively) or all-cause
               mortality (p=0.1 and 0.1, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Among men
               with intermediate and high-risk PC, we found no statistically
               significant increased risk of adverse long-term outcomes,

               treatment programs for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
               (ROC), the clinical efficacy and safety of poly (ADP-ribose)
               polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) (including olaparib, niraparib, and
               rucaparib) monotherapy as a maintenance treatment for
               platinum-sensitive ROC were systematically evaluated. Methods:
               Numerous electronic databases were systematically searched for
               randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PARPi maintenance
               treatment for ROC that were published before June 2021. The
               primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and
               progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint was
               grade 3-4 adverse effects (AEs). After data extraction and the
               quality evaluation of the included studies, Bayesian network
               meta-analysis (NMA) was performed using R software. The ability
               of each treatment was ranked using the surface under the
               cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve. Results: The analysis included
               five studies and 1390 patients. The NMA results demonstrated
               that compared with the placebo, olaparib and niraparib exhibited
               significant benefits in the gBRCA-mutated population, and
               respectively reduced the risk of death by 31\% (HR = 0.69, 95\%
               CI: 0.53-0.90) and 34\% (HR = 0.66, 95\% CI: 0.44-0.99).
               Olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib were all found to be very
               effective in prolonging PFS in patients with ROC. All three
               PARPi treatments increased the number of grade 3-4 AEs in
               patients with ROC as compared with the placebo. Conclusions:
               Overall, olaparib and niraparib maintenance treatment can
               significantly prolong the OS of patients with gBRCA mutations.
               Furthermore, the three investigated PARPi monotherapy
               maintenance treatments can prolong PFS regardless of BRCA
               mutation status. Although the incidence of AEs in the treatment
               groups was found to be significantly higher than that in the
               placebo group, the patients in the treatment group tolerated the
               treatment. Home oral PARPi treatment can balance tumor treatment
               and pandemic prevention and control, and is the most convenient,
               safe, and effective home treatment method available against the
               background of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic Review

               to bolster their general health and to decrease the risk of

               this study was to study the type and the documentation of
               patients' dietary supplements and vitamins in the electronic
               medical record (EMR). METHODS: 50/51 female breast cancer
               survivors seen over a 7 week period consented to the study. Mean
               age was 70 and mean years since diagnosis was 13.9. Informed
               consent and documentation of supplement and vitamin use was
               obtained by the nurse practitioner the day before the visit.
               Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic
               data capture tools hosted at Weill Cornell Medicine. RESULTS: Of
               the 50 study patients, 90\% were taking one or more vitamins
               and/or supplements (mean = 2.4, range = 1-9). The most common
               were Vitamin D, calcium, and vitamin C. Reasons for vitamin and
               supplement use included the recommendation by their physician or
               friend and prevention of bone loss or catching a cold. Five
               patients mentioned immunity or prevention of COVID-19. The
               patient reported list was compared with the medication list used
               by multiple providers in the electronic medical record (EMR).
               None of the 50 study patients had an accurate list of their
               vitamins and supplements in the EMR. CONCLUSION: 90\% of the
               breast cancer survivors in our study were taking dietary
               supplements for a variety of reasons. None had an accurate list
               in the EMR. We strongly recommend more attention to accurate and
               easily accessed vitamin and supplement recording by providers.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: To determine the credibility of online urological
               information that medical students are likely to encounter,
               determine possible discrepancies between the credibility of
               information pertaining to different areas within urology
               (especially those less relevant to patients), and assess trends
               in the sponsorship of online urological educational material.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: Health on the Net (HON) principles were
               used as a validated benchmark to assess the reliability of
               websites which appeared in the first 150 results of a search
               using the Google search engine. A variety of urological search
               terms were used, grouped into three broad categories with
               varying relevance to patients and medical students. Further
               analysis focused on the sponsorship of assessed websites.
               RESULTS: 5,400 websites were assessed for validation over a set
               of 36 search terms. Only 843/5400 (15.6\%) of these were HONcode
               accredited, indicating a large proportion of unverified and
               potentially unreliable information. Search engine rankings
               usually favoured accredited websites (P=0.0093), and
               accreditation peaked at 51.1\% (184/360) in the first page of
               results, but sorting became weaker outside the highest search
               results. The percentage of accredited websites varied
               significantly between different subcategories of search terms
               such as conditions (18.3\% (329/1800), P=0.0029) and procedures
               (13.5\% (243/1800), P=0.0426). Governmental/educational and
               commercial sources supported the majority of websites assessed
               for sponsorship (21\% and 33\% (31/150 and 49/150)
               respectively), and the former were more likely rank highly in
               search results. CONCLUSION: Online urological information
               frequently lacks validation and is often of indeterminate
               credibility. There is a marked decrease in the proportion of
               accredited websites beyond the highest-ranked results and when
               considering search categories more relevant to students and less
               relevant to patients. Students cannot necessarily rely on free
               online sources for accurate information, and could benefit from
               the development of more rigorous novel tools and platforms.",

              enrolled patients, only two (1.6\%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2
              antibodies on initial blood draw, and no initially seronegative
              patients developed newly detectable antibodies on subsequent

               geriatric emergency care and, more specifically, detection of ED

               experiences obtaining collateral information on older adults
               with cognitive dysfunction, both before and during the COVID-19
               pandemic. METHODS: From February to May 2021, we conducted
               semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 22
               emergency physicians and advanced practice providers from two
               urban academic hospitals and one community hospital in the
               Northeast United States. Interviews lasted 10-20 min and were
               digitally recorded and transcribed. Interview transcripts were
               analyzed for dominant themes using a combined
               deductive-inductive approach. Responses regarding experiences

               major challenges emerged regarding (1) availability of

               (4) time constraints, and (5) incomplete transfer documentation.
               Participants perceived all challenges, but those relating to
               transfer documentation were amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic.

               ICIs demonstrated a modest benefit in treating breast cancer
               (BC), with the exception of certain subsets of triple-negative
               BCs. An immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment (TME),
               typically present in BC, is an important factor in the poor
               response to immunotherapy. After almost two decades of poor
               clinical trial results, cancer vaccines (CVs), an active
               immunotherapy, have come back in the spotlight because of some
               technological advancements, ultimately boosted by coronavirus

               insight into COVID-19 immunopathology by targeted proteomic
               analysis of pulmonary and splenic tissues. Lung parenchymal and
               splenic tissue was obtained from 13 post-mortem examinations of
               patients with fatal COVID-19. Control tissue was obtained from
               cancer resection samples (lung) and deceased organ donors
               (spleen). Protein was extracted from tissue by phenol
               extraction. Olink\textregistered{} multiplex immunoassay panels
               were used for protein detection and quantification. Proteins
               with increased abundance in the lung included MCP-3, antiviral
               TRIM21 and pro-thrombotic TYMP. OSM and EN-RAGE/S100A12
               abundance was correlated, and associated with inflammation
               severity. Unsupervised clustering identified 'early viral' and
               'late inflammatory' clusters with distinct protein abundance
               profiles, and differences in illness duration prior to death and
               presence of viral RNA. In the spleen, lymphocyte chemotactic
               factors and CD8A were decreased in abundance, and pro-apoptotic
               factors were increased. B-cell receptor signalling pathway
               components and macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) were
               also increased. Additional evidence for a sub-set of host
               factors (including DDX58, OSM, TYMP, IL-18, MCP-3 and CSF-1) was
               provided by overlap between (i) differential abundance in spleen
               and lung tissue, (ii) meta-analysis of existing datasets, and
               (iii) plasma proteomic data. This proteomic analysis of lung
               parenchymal and splenic tissue from fatal COVID-19 provides
               mechanistic insight into tissue anti-viral responses,
               inflammation and disease stages, macrophage involvement,
               pulmonary thrombosis, splenic B-cell activation and lymphocyte
               depletion. This article is open access and distributed under the

               of AXL targeting.In the present study, we compared the cellular
               phenotypes of CRISPR-Cas9-induced depletion of AXL and its
               pharmacological inhibition with bemcentinib, LDC1267 and

               cell viability and invasion, the endo-lysosomal system and

               has made a significant progress in the treatment of chronic

               reduction of cytokine release, it is effective in chronic
               graft-versus-host disease, and its use has also been suggested
               in autoimmune diseases and in prevention of COVID-19-associated
               lung damage. Despite this effect on the immune response, we
               report a severe hypersensitivity reaction in a 76-year-old male
               patient diagnosed with prolymphocytic leukemia. Four weeks after
               the ibrutinib start, non-oliguric acute kidney injury with
               proteinuria and microscopic hematuria developed and that was
               accompanied by lower limb purpuras and paresthesia. Renal biopsy
               revealed acute interstitial nephritis. Employing 1 mg/kg

               device: the world's first sterile, single-use grasper integrated
               flexible cystoscope (SUGIFC) for ureteral stent removal.
               METHODS: After PROSPERO registration (CRD42021228755), the
               Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
               Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized. The search
               terms ``Grasper Integrated Flexible Cystoscope,'' and
               ``Isiris,'' within the following databases: PubMed, Scopus,
               Cochrane Library, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched.
               RESULTS: In this review, a cumulative total experience (10
               publications) included 970 ``SUGIFC'' procedures (755 patients).
               However, only 366/970 procedures were actually used for
               ``ureteral stent removal,'' with the remainder being
               surveillance cystoscopy only (603/970) or foreign body retrieval
               (1/970). Procedure-related and device failures in planned
               ``removal of ureteral stents,'' was reported in 8/366 (346
               patients) and 1/366 (346 patients), respectively. The
               cost-benefit utilizing the SUGIFC device is advantageous
               compared to ``in-theatre'' stent removals and favours less busy
               centres where maintenance, repair and replacement costs are more
               relevant. Other listed benefits include shorter stent indwelling
               times, shorter procedure duration, lower rates of bacteriuria
               and urinary tract infections, fewer emergency department visits
               and lower readmission rates. Technical limitations include the
               absence of an independent working channel, a narrower visual
               field and the lack of image universality since the monitor is
               device-specific. CONCLUSION: The SUGIFC device needs to be
               outweighed against local costs and individual health systems.
               Its application in ambulatory ureteral stent removal may become
               significant due to the accessibility and convenience that it
               offers the attending urologist.",

               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine-induced immune responses in
               patients with cancer are needed to optimize clinical care. In a
               prospective cohort study of 366 (291 vaccinated) patients, we
               measured antibody levels [anti-spike (IgG-(S-RBD) and
               anti-nucleocapsid immunoglobulin] at three time points. Antibody
               level trajectories and frequency of breakthrough infections were
               evaluated by tumor type and timing of treatment relative to
               vaccination. IgG-(S-RBD) at peak response (median = 42 days
               after dose 2) was higher (P = 0.002) and remained higher after 4
               to 6 months (P = 0.003) in patients receiving mRNA-1273 compared
               with BNT162b2. Patients with solid tumors attained higher peak
               levels (P = 0.001) and sustained levels after 4 to 6 months (P <
               0.001) compared with those with hematologic malignancies. B-cell
               targeted treatment reduced peak (P = 0.001) and sustained
               antibody responses (P = 0.003). Solid tumor patients receiving
               immune checkpoint inhibitors before vaccination had lower
               sustained antibody levels than those who received treatment
               after vaccination (P = 0.043). Two (0.69\%) vaccinated and one
               (1.9\%) unvaccinated patient had severe COVID-19 illness during
               follow-up. Our study shows variation in sustained antibody
               responses across cancer populations receiving various
               therapeutic modalities, with important implications for vaccine
               booster timing and patient selection. SIGNIFICANCE: Long-term
               studies of immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients
               with cancer are needed to inform evidence-based guidelines for
               booster vaccinations and to tailor sequence and timing of

               prognostic value of NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic

               hypothesis that an elevated NT-proBNP concentration at admission
               is associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Methods and
               Results In this prospective, observational cohort study of the
               American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease
               Registry, 4675 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were divided
               into normal and elevated NT-proBNP cohorts by standard
               age-adjusted heart failure thresholds, as well as separated by
               quintiles. Patients with elevated NT-proBNP (n=1344; 28.7\%)
               were older, with more cardiovascular risk factors, and had a
               significantly higher rate of in-hospital mortality (37\% versus
               16\%; P<0.001) and shorter median time to death (7 versus 9
               days; P<0.001) than those with normal values. Analysis by
               quintile of NT-proBNP revealed a steep graded relationship with
               mortality (7.1\%-40.2\%; P<0.001). NT-proBNP was also associated
               with major adverse cardiac events, intensive care unit
               admission, intubation, shock, and cardiac arrest (P<0.001 for
               each). In subgroup analyses, NT-proBNP, but not prior heart
               failure, was associated with increased risk of in-hospital
               mortality. Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors with
               presenting vital signs, an elevated NT-proBNP was associated
               with 2-fold higher adjusted odds of death (adjusted odds ratio
               [OR], 2.23; 95\% CI, 1.80-2.76), and the log-transformed
               NT-proBNP with other biomarkers projected a 21\% increased risk
               of death for each 2-fold increase (adjusted OR, 1.21; 95\% CI,
               1.08-1.34). Conclusions Elevated NT-proBNP levels on admission

               medications. We evaluated whether these individuals have worse
               outcomes when hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with
               non-immunosuppressed individuals. Methods: We conducted a
               retrospective cohort study using data from the National COVID
               Cohort Collaborative (N3C), the largest longitudinal electronic
               health record repository of patients in hospital with confirmed
               or suspected COVID-19 in the USA, between Jan 1, 2020, and June
               11, 2021, within 42 health systems. We compared adults with
               immunosuppressive medications used before admission to adults
               without long-term immunosuppression. We considered
               immunosuppression overall, as well as by 15 classes of
               medication and three broad indications for immunosuppressive
               medicines. We used Fine and Gray's proportional subdistribution
               hazards models to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of
               invasive mechanical ventilation, with the competing risk of
               death. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs
               for in-hospital death. Models were adjusted using doubly robust
               propensity score methodology. Findings: Among 231 830
               potentially eligible adults in the N3C repository who were
               admitted to hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 during
               the study period, 222 575 met the inclusion criteria (mean age
               59 years [SD 19]; 111 269 [50\%] male). The most common
               comorbidities were diabetes (23\%), pulmonary disease (17\%),
               and renal disease (13\%). 16 494 (7\%) patients had long-term
               immunosuppression with medications for diverse conditions,
               including rheumatological disease (33\%), solid organ transplant
               (26\%), or cancer (22\%). In the propensity score matched cohort
               (including 12 841 immunosuppressed patients and 29 386
               non-immunosuppressed patients), immunosuppression was associated
               with a reduced risk of invasive ventilation (HR 0·89, 95\% CI
               0·83-0·96) and there was no overall association between
               long-term immunosuppression and the risk of in-hospital death.
               None of the 15 medication classes examined were associated with
               an increased risk of invasive mechanical ventilation. Although
               there was no statistically significant association between most
               drugs and in-hospital death, increases were found with rituximab
               for rheumatological disease (1·72, 1·10-2·69) and for cancer
               (2·57, 1·86-3·56). Results were generally consistent across
               subgroup analyses that considered race and ethnicity or sex, as
               well as across sensitivity analyses that varied exposure,
               covariate, and outcome definitions. Interpretation: Among this
               cohort, with the exception of rituximab, there was no increased
               risk of mechanical ventilation or in-hospital death for the
               rheumatological, antineoplastic, or antimetabolite therapies
               examined. Funding: None.",

               encompasses steatosis and steatohepatitis. The cause may be
               multifactorial, and diagnosis requires correlation with clinical
               information and laboratory results. OBJECTIVE.---: To provide an
               overview of the status of histology diagnosis of steatosis,
               steatohepatitis, and associated conditions. DATA SOURCES.---: A
               literature search was performed using the PubMed search engine.
               The terms ''steatosis,'' ''steatohepatitis,'' ''nonalcoholic
               fatty liver disease (NAFLD),'' ''nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

               (DILI),'' ``immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,'' and
               ``COVID-19 and liver'' were used. CONCLUSIONS.---: Nonalcoholic
               fatty liver disease has become the most common chronic liver
               disease in the United States. NASH is the progressive form of
               nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The hallmarks of
               steatohepatitis are steatosis, ballooned hepatocytes, and
               lobular inflammation. NASH and alcoholic steatohepatitis share
               similar histologic features, but some subtle differences may
               help their distinction. NASH is commonly seen in patients with
               metabolic dysfunction but can also be caused by other
               etiologies. Examples are medications including newly developed
               immune checkpoint inhibitors and viral infections such as
               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). NASH is also a common cause
               of cryptogenic cirrhosis but can be reversed. The results from
               recent clinical trials for NASH treatment are promising in
               reducing the severity of steatosis, ballooning, and fibrosis.",

               very poor prognosis despite the improvement of therapeutic
               means, of which metastases at the colic level are exceptional.
               We report an exceptional case which makes it possible to enrich
               the poor literature published on the subject. CASE PRESENTATION:
               Through this article, we present a very rare case of colonic
               metastases from ovarian cancer. Biological monitoring and rectal
               bleeding allowed this rare secondary location to be discovered.
               Resection then anastomosis allowed our patient to heal. The
               objectives of this work are threefold: i), to report this very
               rare case ovarian metastasis ii), to highlight nulliparity as a
               risk factor in our patient iii), to report that our therapeutic
               management interrupted and delayed because of COVID 19.
               DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our case report shows that we have to
               take into consideration this very rare presentation and this
               even in the absence of true clinical sign. Our work reported
               also another case of colonic metastasis of a primary ovarian in
               the very rare case described in the literature and emphasizes
               the importance of surgical management.",

               context of the Patient Preference in Benefit-Risk Assessments
               during the Drug Life Cycle (PREFER) project. Among the main
               advantages were the possibility of reaching a wider and
               geographically distant population in a shorter timeframe while
               reducing the financial costs of testing, the greater flexibility
               offered and the reduced burden on the patients. Some limitations
               were also identified and should be the object of further
               research, including the potential lack of inclusiveness of the
               research, the lack of control over who is completing the survey,
               a poor comprehension of the study material, and ultimately a
               lower level of engagement with the study. Despite these
               limitations, experience from the PREFER project suggests that

               tissue spatial information. These spatially resolved
               transcriptomics make it feasible to examine the complex
               multicellular systems of different microenvironments. To answer
               scientific questions with spatial transcriptomics and expand our
               understanding of how cell types and states are regulated by
               microenvironment, the first step is to identify cell clusters by
               integrating the available spatial information. Here, we
               introduce SC-MEB, an empirical Bayes approach for spatial
               clustering analysis using a hidden Markov random field. We have
               also derived an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm
               based on an iterative conditional mode for SC-MEB. In contrast
               to BayesSpace, a recently developed method, SC-MEB is not only
               computationally efficient and scalable to large sample sizes but
               is also capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the
               number of clusters. We performed comprehensive simulation
               studies to demonstrate the superiority of SC-MEB over some
               existing methods. We applied SC-MEB to analyze the spatial
               transcriptome of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues
               and mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. Our analysis results
               showed that SC-MEB can achieve a similar or better clustering
               performance to BayesSpace, which uses the true number of
               clusters and a fixed smoothness parameter. Moreover, SC-MEB is
               scalable to large 'sample sizes'. We then employed SC-MEB to
               analyze a colon dataset from a patient with colorectal cancer
               (CRC) and COVID-19, and further performed differential
               expression analysis to identify signature genes related to the
               clustering results. The heatmap of identified signature genes
               showed that the clusters identified using SC-MEB were more
               separable than those obtained with BayesSpace. Using pathway
               analysis, we identified three immune-related clusters, and in a
               further comparison, found the mean expression of COVID-19
               signature genes was greater in immune than non-immune regions of
               colon tissue. SC-MEB provides a valuable computational tool for

  abstract  = "Purpose: In the United States, Hispanics are more likely to be
               diagnosed with cervical cancer compared to Non-Hispanic Whites.
               Annually, 250,000 to 1 million women are diagnosed with a
               precursor to CC. The aim of this study was to assess whether
               Hispanics have a higher prevalence of cervical dysplasia
               compared to Non-Hispanics Whites among a population of
               low-income women. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the results
               of 10,911 cervical cytology tests administered between 2003 and
               2016 that were funded through the Center for Disease Control and
               Prevention's (CDC) program for low-income, uninsured women
               entitled the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection
               Program (NBCCEDP). In the state of Arizona, the program is
               called the Well Women HealthCheck Program (WWHP). Logistic
               regression was used to identify increased risk of dysplasia,
               including low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and
               high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL/ICC), and
               multinomial logistic regression was used to assess increased
               likelihood for LSIL and HSIL/ICC as separate categories.
               Results: In the crude analysis, Hispanic ethnicity was modestly
               associated with higher prevalence of LSIL (odds ratio (OR)=1.39,
               95\% CI=1.01-1.91), but this association was not statistically
               significant after adjusting for confounders. However, in the
               final models, lower income was independently associated with
               LSIL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.55, 95\% CI=1.30-1.44), while
               smoking (aOR=2.88, 95\% CI=1.21-6.84) and no history of Pap test
               within five years (aOR=3.54, 95\% CI=1.61-6.99) were
               independently associated with HSIL. Conclusion: After adjusting
               for confounding in a sample of low-income women with comparable
               Pap screening rates, ethnicity was not associated with greater
               prevalence of abnormal pap smears. However, other variables were
               independently associated with LSIL and HSIL. The higher
               proportion of LSIL cases among lower income individuals compared
               to those with higher incomes, and the higher proportion of HSIL
               cases observed among those screened least regularly stresses the
               importance of programs like WWHP: programs that target
               low-income, uninsured women. These programs help save lives.",

               RESULTS: The findings revealed that GBM tissues had higher CTSL
               expression levels than that of normal brain tissues, which was
               associated with a significantly lower survival rate in GBM
               patients. Meanwhile, the expression level of CTSL negatively
               correlated with purity, B cell and CD8+ T cell in GBM. CTSL
               inhibitor significantly reduced growth and induced mitochondrial
               apoptosis. CONCLUSION: According to the findings, CTSL acts as
               an independent prognostic factor and can be considered as
               promising therapeutic target for GBM.",

               identify potential patient-level contraindicators for
               telegenetic genetic counseling. METHODS: We analyzed
               post-counseling (pre-result disclosure) follow-up data from a
               randomized noninferiority trial of a telephone genetic
               counseling versus usual care genetic counseling. Among 669
               randomized participants, 600 completed pre-test counseling and
               568 completed a 2-week follow-up assessment before receiving
               test results. In this analysis, we focused on genetic counseling
               outcomes (knowledge, decisional conflict, and distress). In
               multivariate models controlling for bivariate predictors of
               these outcomes, we tested our a priori hypotheses that
               pre-counseling numeracy, perceived stress, and race/ethnicity
               would moderate the outcomes of telephone genetic counseling
               versus usual care. RESULTS: Only numeracy significantly
               moderated associations between mode of genetic counseling and
               outcomes. Higher numeracy was associated with higher
               post-counseling knowledge following telephone genetic counseling
               (p 0.20). CONCLUSION: Although high numeracy was associated with
               higher levels of knowledge following telegenetic counseling, we
               did not identify any clinically significant patient-level
               contraindicators for telegenetic counseling. These results lend
               further confidence to the broad use of telegenetics.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Bladder exstrophy is a rare congenital anomaly
               while, bladder adenocarcinoma mucinous type is a rare type of
               bladder cancer, with aggressive behavior and inadequate response
               to radiation and chemotherapy. In extremely rare cases,
               untreated bladder exstrophy could transform into bladder
               mucinous adenocarcinoma. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of
               a 41-year-old male with untreated bladder exstrophy that
               transformed into mucinous adenocarcinoma. The patient also had
               epispadias and a right inguinal hernia. Joint procedures were
               conducted to perform radical cystectomy, total penectomy and
               W-Pouch continent urostomy, inguinal hernia repair, osteotomy,
               and keystone and scrotal flap by split-thickness skin graft
               (STSG) for wound closure. The patient progressed well after
               surgery, two months after initial procedure, nephrostomies were
               conducted due to pouches stenosis. Due to the government's
               limited transportation and lockdown policy, as the Covid-19
               pandemic occurred, the patient could not come to the hospital
               for routine follow-up and died nine-month after surgery.
               CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Bladder exstrophy is one of the risk
               factors of bladder cancer. Transformation of bladder exstrophy
               into mucinous adenocarcinoma is extremely rare, as the case is
               the first case to be discovered in Indonesia. Surgery, followed
               with a strict follow-up regime, is mainstay of treatment in this
               type of malignancy. CONCLUSION: Adenocarcinoma of mucinous type
               is a scarce type of bladder exstrophy malignancies. A
               multidiscipline approach is mandatory in these cases. Strict and
               regular follow up are suggested for these cases.",

               are undoubtedly the most challenging treatments for patients.
               Older and frail patients are not always able to tolerate it, and
               there are still no clear guidelines on the type of treatments to
               be preferred for them. The recommendations for Risk-Adapted H\&N
               Cancer Radiation Therapy during the coronavirus disease 2019
               (COVID-19) pandemic provided by the ASTRO-ESTRO consensus
               statement achieved a strong agreement about hypofractionated RT
               (HFRT). A systematic literature review was conducted in order to
               evaluate the feasibility and safety of HFRT for older patients
               affected by H\&N malignancies. Materials and Methods: A
               systematic database search was performed on PubMed and Embase
               according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
               and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Original studies, case
               series, and case reports describing the use of HFRT (with at
               least 2.2 Gy fractions) in patients with mean age $\geq$65 years
               were included. The analysis was based on the type of study,
               number of patients, mean age, tumor site, histology, performance
               status (PS), RT details, concomitant chemotherapy (CT), and
               described clinical outcomes. All the reported doses have been
               calculated in equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) and
               biologically effective dose (BED) using $\alpha$/$\beta$ = 10 Gy
               or $\alpha$/$\beta$ = 12 Gy. Results: We selected 17 papers that
               met the inclusion criteria and divided them in 4 categories: 6
               articles analyze HFRT performed twice daily in repeated cycles,
               3 once a day in repeated cycles, 4 in alternative days, and the
               last 4 in consecutive days. Conclusion: HFRT seems to be a good
               treatment with an acceptable prolonged disease control. In older
               patients fit for radical treatments, a 55 Gy in 20 fractions
               regimen can be proposed as a valid alternative to the standard
               fractionated RT, but there are a multitude of hypofractionated
               regimens, ranging from single fraction, quad shot, and 1-, 2-,
               3-, 4-, and 5-week schedules that all may be appropriate. The
               correct regimen for a patient depends on many factors, and it
               represents the result of a more specific and complex decision.",

               infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and resulting mortality is also
               increased, emphasising the importance of protecting patients by
               vaccination. Available data in patients with multiple myeloma
               suggest a suboptimal anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response, meaning a
               proportion of patients are unprotected. Factors associated with
               poor response are uncontrolled disease, immunosuppression,
               concomitant therapy, more lines of therapy, and CD38
               antibody-directed and B-cell maturation antigen-directed
               therapy. These facts suggest that monitoring the immune response
               to vaccination in patients with multiple myeloma might provide
               guidance for clinical management, such as administration of
               additional doses of the same or another vaccine, or even
               temporary treatment discontinuation, if possible. In those who
               do not exhibit a good response, prophylactic treatment with
               neutralising monoclonal antibody cocktails might be considered.
               In patients deficient of a SARS-CoV-2 immune response, adherence
               to measures for infection risk reduction is particularly
               recommended. This consensus was generated by members of the

               protective efficacy, vaccine hesitancy and logistical

               postoperative risks of patients with severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exists. METHODS: As part of
               the COVIDSurg multicenter study, all patients aged $\geq$17
               years undergoing surgery between January 1 and June 30, 2020
               with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection in 70 hospitals across
               27 states were included. The primary outcomes were 30-day
               mortality and pulmonary complications. Multivariable analyses
               (adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and procedure
               characteristics) were performed to identify predictors of
               mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,581 patients were included;
               more than half of them were males (n= 822, 52.0\%) and older
               than 50 years (n=835, 52.8\%). Most procedures (n=1,261, 79.8\%)
               were emergent, and laparotomies (n= 538, 34.1\%). The mortality
               and pulmonary complication rates were 11.0 and 39.5\%,
               respectively. Independent predictors of mortality included age
               $\geq$70 years (OR 2.46, 95\% CI [1.65-3.69]), male sex (2.26
               [1.53-3.35]), ASA grades 3-5 (3.08 [1.60-5.95]), emergent
               surgery (2.44 [1.31-4.54]), malignancy (2.97 [1.58-5.57]),
               respiratory comorbidities (2.08 [1.30-3.32]), and higher Revised
               Cardiac Risk Index (1.20 [1.02-1.41]). While statewide elective
               cancelation orders were not associated with a lower mortality, a
               sub-analysis showed it to be associated with lower mortality in
               those who underwent elective surgery (0.14 [0.03-0.61]).

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: The immunogenicity and reactogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
               vaccines in patients with cancer are poorly understood. METHODS:
               We performed a prospective cohort study of adults with
               solid-organ or hematologic cancers to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2
               immunoglobulin A/M/G spike antibodies, neutralization, and
               reactogenicity $\geq$ 7 days following two doses of mRNA-1273,
               BNT162b2, or one dose of Ad26.COV2.S. We analyzed responses by
               multivariate regression and included data from 1,638 healthy
               controls, previously reported, for comparison. RESULTS: Between
               April and July 2021, we enrolled 1,001 patients; 762 were
               eligible for analysis (656 had neutralization measured).
               mRNA-1273 was the most immunogenic (log10 geometric mean
               concentration [GMC] 2.9, log10 geometric mean neutralization
               titer [GMT] 2.3), followed by BNT162b2 (GMC 2.4; GMT 1.9) and
               Ad26.COV2.S (GMC 1.5; GMT 1.4; P < .001). The proportion of low
               neutralization (< 20\% of convalescent titers) among Ad26.COV2.S
               recipients was 69.9\%. Prior COVID-19 infection (in 7.1\% of the
               cohort) was associated with higher responses (P < .001).
               Antibody titers and neutralization were quantitatively lower in
               patients with cancer than in comparable healthy controls,
               regardless of vaccine type (P < .001). Receipt of chemotherapy
               in the prior year or current steroids were associated with lower
               antibody levels and immune checkpoint blockade with higher
               neutralization. Systemic reactogenicity varied by vaccine and
               correlated with immune responses (P = .002 for concentration, P
               = .016 for neutralization). In 32 patients who received an
               additional vaccine dose, side effects were similar to prior
               doses, and 30 of 32 demonstrated increased antibody titers (GMC
               1.05 before additional dose, 3.17 after dose). CONCLUSION:
               Immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are modestly impaired in
               patients with cancer. These data suggest utility of antibody
               testing to identify patients for whom additional vaccine doses
               may be effective and appropriate, although larger prospective
               studies are needed.",

  abstract  = "SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus that causes COVID-19.
               Given its acute and often self-limiting course, it is likely
               that components of the innate immune system play a central part
               in controlling virus replication and determining clinical
               outcome. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with
               notable activity against a broad range of viruses, including RNA
               viruses1,2. NK cell function may be altered during COVID-19
               despite increased representation of NK cells with an activated
               and adaptive phenotype3,4. Here we show that a decline in viral
               load in COVID-19 correlates with NK cell status and that NK
               cells can control SARS-CoV-2 replication by recognizing infected
               target cells. In severe COVID-19, NK cells show defects in virus
               control, cytokine production and cell-mediated cytotoxicity
               despite high expression of cytotoxic effector molecules.
               Single-cell RNA sequencing of NK cells over the time course of
               the COVID-19 disease spectrum reveals a distinct gene expression
               signature. Transcriptional networks of interferon-driven NK cell
               activation are superimposed by a dominant transforming growth
               factor-$\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) response signature, with reduced
               expression of genes related to cell-cell adhesion, granule
               exocytosis and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In severe COVID-19,
               serum levels of TGF$\beta$ peak during the first two weeks of
               infection, and serum obtained from these patients severely
               inhibits NK cell function in a TGF$\beta$-dependent manner. Our
               data reveal that an untimely production of TGF$\beta$ is a
               hallmark of severe COVID-19 and may inhibit NK cell function and
               early control of the virus.",

               Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre (VCCC), a multisite cancer
               center alliance, was to increase palliative care clinical trial
               expertise. The palliative care services within the VCCC alliance
               presented substantial trial development opportunities with large
               number of patients and established relationships, but few
               trial-active centers. Objectives: To establish a multi-site
               ``Building Capability in Palliative Care Clinical Trials''
               program as a service development, and to assess the strategies,
               activities, and the outcomes resulting from this program.
               Methods: A series of strategies and activities were developed
               linked to the key program objectives of increasing the number of
               clinical sites and skilled clinicians conducting clinical
               trials, increasing the number of trials available and patients
               participating, broadening research opportunities in palliative
               care, and establishing the program sustainability. Results: In
               the two years of implementation, the program resulted in the
               establishment and conduct of several Phase 4 postmarketing
               pharmacovigilance studies, nine Phase 2 and 3 trials across five
               palliative care services, and a Phase 1 clinical trial. During
               the program, 150 patients were recruited to clinical trials, and
               258 prospective pharmacovigilance monitoring cases were
               recorded. Five investigator-initiated trials were developed by
               clinical trial fellows and achieved competitive (n = 3) or
               commercial (n = 2) funding. Clinicians reported that undertaking
               clinical trials had increased attention to the evidence base of
               care provision, and increased service research activity more
               broadly. Long-term sustainability remains a challenge,
               particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
               Conclusions: Clinical trials in palliative care services are
               feasible, acceptable, and result in increased attention to the
               evidence base of care. The strategies detailing the framework,
               activities, and outcomes have been collated to facilitate
               implementation of clinical trials in other sites and with other

               their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the
               Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
               Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess evidence and make
               recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS:
               The panel agreed on one additional recommendation. The panel
               issued a conditional recommendation against the use of
               outpatient anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19
               being discharged from the hospital who do not have suspected or
               confirmed VTE or another indication for anticoagulation.
               CONCLUSIONS: This recommendation was based on very low certainty
               in the evidence, underscoring the need for high-quality,
               randomized controlled trials assessing the role of
               post-discharge thromboprophylaxis. Other key research priorities
               include better evidence on assessing risk of thrombosis and
               bleeding outcomes in patients with COVID-19 after hospital
               discharge.",

               without patient cost-sharing in the same way as in

               evaluated whether the utilization of preventive services is
               similar between Marketplace enrollees and ESI enrollees. Using
               the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data for 2014-2016, we
               identified working-age women with Marketplace plans (n = 792, N

               medical care showed the strongest association with the receipt
               of all investigated preventive services. With the increased role
               of the Marketplace as a safety net in the COVID-19 pandemic,

               effectiveness and enhance viral transmission on the other.
               Inequity in vaccine distribution, primarily an ethical issue,
               challenges this equilibrium, as industrialized countries prepare
               to administer a third booster dose to their population. Solid
               tumor cancer patients typically respond well to initial full
               vaccination and someone could argue that they should not be
               prioritized for an adjuvant third dose, since protection from
               severe disease has largely been achieved with the two-dose
               regimen. Nevertheless, their immune status is dynamic and not
               all of them exhibit an adequate immune response. A booster third
               dose is necessary for the inadequate responders, while it will
               result in better protection of all patients from mild disease as
               well, which if presented could have ominous consequences due to
               their overall frailty, and their need to adhere to strict

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Functional impairment of interferon, a natural
               antiviral component of the immune system, is associated with the
               pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19. We aimed to compare the
               efficacy of interferon beta-1a in combination with remdesivir
               compared with remdesivir alone in hospitalised patients with
               COVID-19. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised,
               placebo-controlled trial at 63 hospitals across five countries
               (Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, and the USA). Eligible
               patients were hospitalised adults (aged $\geq$18 years) with
               SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test,
               and who met one of the following criteria suggestive of lower
               respiratory tract infection: the presence of radiographic
               infiltrates on imaging, a peripheral oxygen saturation on room
               air of 94\% or less, or requiring supplemental oxygen. Patients
               were excluded if they had either an alanine aminotransferase or
               an aspartate aminotransferase concentration more than five times
               the upper limit of normal; had impaired renal function; were
               allergic to the study product; were pregnant or breast feeding;
               were already on mechanical ventilation; or were anticipating
               discharge from the hospital or transfer to another hospital
               within 72 h of enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1)
               to receive intravenous remdesivir as a 200 mg loading dose on
               day 1 followed by a 100 mg maintenance dose administered daily
               for up to 9 days and up to four doses of either 44 $\mu$g
               interferon beta-1a (interferon beta-1a group plus remdesivir
               group) or placebo (placebo plus remdesivir group) administered
               subcutaneously every other day. Randomisation was stratified by
               study site and disease severity at enrolment. Patients,
               investigators, and site staff were masked to interferon beta-1a
               and placebo treatment; remdesivir treatment was given to all
               patients without masking. The primary outcome was time to
               recovery, defined as the first day that a patient attained a
               category 1, 2, or 3 score on the eight-category ordinal scale
               within 28 days, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat
               population, defined as all randomised patients who were
               classified according to actual clinical severity. Safety was
               assessed in the as-treated population, defined as all patients
               who received at least one dose of the assigned treatment. This
               trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04492475.
               FINDINGS: Between Aug 5, 2020, and Nov 11, 2020, 969 patients
               were enrolled and randomly assigned to the interferon beta-1a
               plus remdesivir group (n=487) or to the placebo plus remdesivir
               group (n=482). The mean duration of symptoms before enrolment
               was 8·7 days (SD 4·4) in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir
               group and 8·5 days (SD 4·3) days in the placebo plus remdesivir
               group. Patients in both groups had a time to recovery of 5 days
               (95\% CI not estimable) (rate ratio of interferon beta-1a plus
               remdesivir group vs placebo plus remdesivir 0·99 [95\% CI
               0·87-1·13]; p=0·88). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of mortality at
               28 days was 5\% (95\% CI 3-7\%) in the interferon beta-1a plus
               remdesivir group and 3\% (2-6\%) in the placebo plus remdesivir
               group (hazard ratio 1·33 [95\% CI 0·69-2·55]; p=0·39). Patients
               who did not require high-flow oxygen at baseline were more
               likely to have at least one related adverse event in the
               interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group (33 [7\%] of 442
               patients) than in the placebo plus remdesivir group (15 [3\%] of
               435). In patients who required high-flow oxygen at baseline, 24
               (69\%) of 35 had an adverse event and 21 (60\%) had a serious
               adverse event in the interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir group
               compared with 13 (39\%) of 33 who had an adverse event and eight
               (24\%) who had a serious adverse event in the placebo plus
               remdesivir group. INTERPRETATION: Interferon beta-1a plus
               remdesivir was not superior to remdesivir alone in hospitalised
               patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients who required
               high-flow oxygen at baseline had worse outcomes after treatment
               with interferon beta-1a compared with those given placebo.

               incapacitated, had not undergone UPP, or had either missing or
               outlying (three SDs greater than the mean of all consenting
               participants) values of body-mass index, plasma glucose, or
               serum creatinine. The UPP was assessed by capillary
               electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. The
               multidimensional UPP signature reflecting ageing was generated
               from the derivation dataset and validated in the time-shifted
               internal validation dataset and the synchronous validation
               dataset. It was further validated in patients with diabetes,
               COVID-19, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). In FLEMENGHO, the
               mortality endpoints were all-cause, cardiovascular, and
               non-cardiovascular mortality; other endpoints were fatal or
               non-fatal cancer and musculoskeletal disorders. Molecular
               pathway exploration was done using the Reactome and Kyoto
               Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Findings: 778
               individuals (395 [51\%] women and 383 [49\%] men; aged 16·2-82·1
               years; mean age 50·9 years [SD 15·8]) from the FLEMENGHO cohort
               had a follow-up examination between 2005 and 2010, of whom 559
               participants had a further follow-up from Oct 28, 2009, to March
               19, 2013, and made up the derivation (2005-10) and time-shifted
               internal validation (2009-13) datasets. 219 were examined once
               and constituted the synchronous internal validation dataset
               (2005-10). With correction for multiple testing and
               multivariable adjustment, chronological age was associated with
               210 sequenced peptides mainly showing downregulation of collagen
               fragments. The trained model relating chronological age to UPP,
               derived by elastic net regression, included 54 peptides from 17
               proteins. The UPP-age prediction model explained 76·3\% (r=0·87)
               of chronological age in the derivation dataset, 54·4\% (r=0·74)
               in the time-shifted validation dataset, and 65·3\% (r=0·81) in
               the synchronous internal validation dataset. Compared with
               chronological age, the predicted UPP-age was greater in patients
               with diabetes (chronological age 50·8 years [SE 0·37] vs UPP-age
               56·9 years [0·30]), COVID‑19 (53·2 years [1·80] vs 58·5 years
               [1·67]), or CKD (54·6 years [0·97] vs 62·3 years [0·85]; all
               p<0·0001). In the FLEMENGHO cohort, independent of chronological
               age, UPP-age was significantly associated with various risk
               markers related to cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disease,
               inflammation, and medication use. Over a median of 12·4 years
               (IQR 10·8-13·2), total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and
               osteoporosis in the population was associated with UPP-age
               independent of chronological age, with hazard ratios per 10 year
               increase in UPP-age of 1·54 (95\% CI 1·22-1·95) for total
               mortality, 1·72 (1·20-2·47) for cardiovascular mortality, and
               1·40 (1·06-1·85) for osteoporosis and fractures. The most
               relevant molecular pathways informed by the proteins involved
               deregulation of collagen biology and extracellular matrix
               maintenance. Interpretation: The UPP signature indicative of
               ageing reflects fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodelling
               and was associated with risk factors and adverse health outcomes
               in the population and with accelerated ageing in patients.

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has
               correlated with the disruption of screening activities and
               diagnostic assessments. Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the
               most common gynecological malignancies and it is often detected
               at an early stage, because it frequently produces symptoms.
               Here, we aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on
               patterns of presentation and treatment of EC patients. METHODS:
               This is a retrospective study involving 54 centers in Italy. We
               evaluated patterns of presentation and treatment of EC patients
               before (period 1: March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and during
               (period 2: April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) the COVID-19
               outbreak. RESULTS: Medical records of 5,164 EC patients have
               been retrieved: 2,718 and 2,446 women treated in period 1 and
               period 2, respectively. Surgery was the mainstay of treatment in
               both periods (p=0.356). Nodal assessment was omitted in 689
               (27.3\%) and 484 (21.2\%) patients treated in period 1 and 2,
               respectively (p<0.001). While, the prevalence of patients
               undergoing sentinel node mapping (with or without backup
               lymphadenectomy) has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic
               (46.7\% in period 1 vs. 52.8\% in period 2; p<0.001). Overall,
               1,280 (50.4\%) and 1,021 (44.7\%) patients had no adjuvant
               therapy in period 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). Adjuvant
               therapy use has increased during COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001).
               CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had a
               significant impact on the characteristics and patterns of care
               of EC patients. These findings highlight the need to implement

               (P-POCUS) probes plug directly into a cell phone or tablet to
               function as its display, creating the potential to increase
               access to obstetric ultrasonography in complex healthcare
               settings (COVID units, low resource settings); however, new
               technology must be proven to be reliable in the obstetric
               setting before integrating into practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
               the intraclass correlation (reliability) of
               personal-device-based-point-of-care-ultrasound devices as
               compared with standard ultrasound machines in obstetrics. STUDY
               DESIGN: This was a prospective, observational study of patients
               between 19-39 weeks gestation in an urban, prenatal ultrasound
               diagnosis center. Each patient underwent assessment by an expert
               sonographer using standard ultrasound machines and
               personal-device-based-point-of-care-ultrasound devices to
               determine estimated fetal weight. The statistical reliability
               and agreement between the estimated fetal weights was assessed
               through intraclass correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots,
               and Pearson correlation coefficients. RESULTS: 100 paired sets
               of scans were performed from October 2020 to December 2020. For
               the estimated fetal weights, there was near-perfect agreement,
               with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.99 (P<.0001).
               Bland-Altman analysis showed an average difference of 53 grams,
               with 95\% limit of agreement between -178 grams and 283 grams.
               Pearson correlation showed near-perfect correlation between the
               measurements (r=0.99, P<.0001). CONCLUSION:
               personal-device-based point-of-care-ultrasound devices are
               reliable tools for performing basic obstetrical ultrasound and
               have the potential to increase access to obstetrical ultrasound

  abstract  = "N-[4-hydroxyphenyl]retinamide, commonly known as fenretinide, a
               synthetic retinoid with pleiotropic benefits for human health,
               is currently utilized in clinical trials for cancer, cystic
               fibrosis, and COVID-19. However, fenretinide reduces plasma
               vitamin A levels by interacting with retinol-binding protein 4
               (RBP4), which often results in reversible night blindness in
               patients. Cell culture and in vitro studies show that
               fenretinide binds and inhibits the activity of $\beta$-carotene
               oxygenase 1 (BCO1), the enzyme responsible for endogenous
               vitamin A formation. Whether fenretinide inhibits vitamin A
               synthesis in mammals, however, remains unknown. The goal of this
               study was to determine if the inhibition of BCO1 by fenretinide
               affects vitamin A formation in mice fed $\beta$-carotene. Our
               results show that wild-type mice treated with fenretinide for
               ten days had a reduction in tissue vitamin A stores accompanied
               by a two-fold increase in $\beta$-carotene in plasma (P < 0.01)
               and several tissues. These effects persisted in RBP4-deficient
               mice and were independent of changes in intestinal
               $\beta$-carotene absorption, suggesting that fenretinide
               inhibits vitamin A synthesis in mice. Using Bco1-/- and Bco2-/-
               mice we also show that fenretinide regulates intestinal
               carotenoid and vitamin E uptake by activating vitamin A
               signaling during short-term vitamin A deficiency. This study
               provides a deeper understanding of the impact of fenretinide on
               vitamin A, carotenoid, and vitamin E homeostasis, which is
               crucial for the pharmacological utilization of this retinoid.",

               of treatment of outpatient (OP) and inpatient (IP) ifosfamide
               therapy. METHODS: A single-center retrospective chart review of
               patients 18 years and older receiving ifosfamide therapy. The
               primary endpoint compares and evaluates the side effect profiles
               of ifosfamide-treated patients in the OP/IP settings. The
               adverse event grading system was characterized using the CTCAE
               Version 5.0. The highest grade was documented per cycle. The
               secondary endpoint of this study compares the costs of OP/IP
               therapy. It was assumed that the cost of medication was
               equivalent for IP/OP treatments. The cost saved with OP
               administration was determined by the average cost of hospital
               stay for IP admission. RESULTS: Ifosfamide therapy of 86
               patients (57 OP, 29 IP) was reviewed. The predominant OP
               regimens were doxorobucin-ifosfamide-mesna (AIM) with 43.9\% and
               ifosfamide-etoposide (IE) with 29.8\%. Grade 4 anemia,
               thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were most frequent in IP vs OP
               therapies (22.9\% IP vs 4.3\% OP, 21.6\% IP vs 9.2\% OP, and
               22.8\% IP vs 19.6\% OP respectively). Neutropenic fever (NF)
               occurred in 20 OP patients which were predominantly treated with
               AIM or IE and led to average hospital stay of 6 days.
               Neurotoxicity, treated with methylene blue (MB) occurred in 4 OP
               patients. OP therapy saved a total of 783 hospital days, leading
               to a cost savings of \$2,103,921. CONCLUSIONS: Transitioning
               ifosfamide to the OP setting is feasible for academic and
               community infusion centers with the OP administration being
               safe, well-tolerated, and associated with decreased total cost

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Motion-mask segmentation from thoracic computed
               tomography (CT) images is the process of extracting the region
               that encompasses lungs and viscera, where large displacements
               occur during breathing. It has been shown to help image
               registration between different respiratory phases. This
               registration step is, for example, useful for radiotherapy
               planning or calculating local lung ventilation. Knowing the
               location of motion discontinuity, that is, sliding motion near
               the pleura, allows a better control of the registration
               preventing unrealistic estimates. Nevertheless, existing methods
               for motion-mask segmentation are not robust enough to be used in
               clinical routine. This article shows that it is feasible to
               overcome this lack of robustness by using a lightweight
               deep-learning approach usable on a standard computer, and this
               even without data augmentation or advanced model design.
               METHODS: A convolutional neural-network architecture with three
               2D U-nets for the three main orientations (sagittal, coronal,
               axial) was proposed. Predictions generated by the three U-nets
               were combined by majority voting to provide a single 3D
               segmentation of the motion mask. The networks were trained on a
               database of nonsmall cell lung cancer 4D CT images of 43
               patients. Training and evaluation were done with a K-fold
               cross-validation strategy. Evaluation was based on a visual
               grading by two experts according to the appropriateness of the
               segmented motion mask for the registration task, and on a
               comparison with motion masks obtained by a baseline method using
               level sets. A second database (76 CT images of patients with
               early-stage COVID-19), unseen during training, was used to
               assess the generalizability of the trained neural network.
               RESULTS: The proposed approach outperformed the baseline method
               in terms of quality and robustness: the success rate increased
               from 53 \% to 79 \% without producing any failure. It also
               achieved a speed-up factor of 60 with GPU, or 17 with CPU. The
               memory footprint was low: less than 5 GB GPU RAM for training
               and less than 1 GB GPU RAM for inference. When evaluated on a
               dataset with images differing by several characteristics (CT
               device, pathology, and field of view), the proposed method
               improved the success rate from 53 \% to 83 \% . CONCLUSION: With
               5-s processing time on a mid-range GPU and success rates around
               80 \% , the proposed approach seems fast and robust enough to be
               routinely used in clinical practice. The success rate can be
               further improved by incorporating more diversity in training
               data via data augmentation and additional annotated images from
               different scanners and diseases. The code and trained model are

               Weeks after an often mild or asymptomatic initial infection with
               SARS-CoV-2 children may present with a severe shock-like picture

               immune response",
  author    = "Grzywa, Tomasz M and Nowis, Dominika and Golab, Jakub",
  abstract  = "Complex regulation of the immune response is necessary to
               support effective defense of an organism against hostile
               invaders and to maintain tolerance to harmless microorganisms
               and autoantigens. Recent studies revealed previously
               unappreciated roles of CD71+ erythroid cells (CECs) in
               regulation of the immune response. CECs physiologically reside
               in the bone marrow where erythropoiesis takes place. Under
               stress conditions, CECs are enriched in some organs outside of
               the bone marrow as a result of extramedullary erythropoiesis.
               However, the role of CECs goes well beyond the production of
               erythrocytes. In neonates, increased numbers of CECs contribute
               to their vulnerability to infectious diseases. On the other
               side, neonatal CECs suppress activation of immune cells in
               response to abrupt colonization with commensal microorganisms
               after delivery. CECs are also enriched in the peripheral blood
               of pregnant women as well as in the placenta and are responsible
               for the regulation of feto-maternal tolerance. In patients with
               cancer, anemia leads to increased frequency of CECs in the
               peripheral blood contributing to diminished antiviral and
               antibacterial immunity, as well as to accelerated cancer
               progression. Moreover, recent studies revealed the role of CECs
               in HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. CECs use a full arsenal of
               mechanisms to regulate immune response. These cells suppress
               proinflammatory responses of myeloid cells and T-cell
               proliferation by the depletion of ʟ-arginine by arginase.
               Moreover, CECs produce reactive oxygen species to decrease
               T-cell proliferation. CECs also secrete cytokines, including
               transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$), which promotes
               T-cell differentiation into regulatory T-cells. Here, we
               comprehensively describe the role of CECs in orchestrating
               immune response and indicate some therapeutic approaches that
               might be used to regulate their effector functions in the

               transient lymphopenia and functional deficits of surviving
               cells. Memory CD8 T cells provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine
               production following re-encounter with their cognate antigen to
               promote long-term immunity, and CD8 T cell impairment due to
               sepsis can pre-dispose individuals to re-infection. While the
               acute influence of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells has been
               characterized, if and to what extent pre-existing memory CD8 T
               cells recover remains unknown. Here, we observed that central
               memory CD8 T cells (TCM) from septic patients proliferate more
               than those from healthy individuals. Utilizing LCMV immune mice
               and a CLP model to induce sepsis, we demonstrated that TCM

               have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin

               The sepsis-induced changes in the composition of the memory CD8

               muscle function over 15 years. These findings reinforce the
               importance of optimising dietary behaviours for healthy ageing.
               INTRODUCTION: Research investigating the roles of individual
               nutrients in muscle health fails to account for the synergistic
               relationships between foods and nutrients. This study aimed to
               investigate the predictive value of diet quality and dietary
               patterns for muscle mass and function in men over a 15-year
               period. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in 522
               men from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study with complete dietary
               and muscle mass or muscle function data at both baseline and
               15-year follow-up assessments. Dietary exposures were extracted
               from food frequency questionnaires and included the Australian
               Recommended Food Score, the Dietary Inflammatory Index
               (DII\textregistered{}), and three a posteriori dietary patterns:
               Plant-focused, Western, and Traditional (Anglo-Australian).
               Outcome variables included dual-energy X-ray
               absorptiometry-derived skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle
               function measured with the timed up-and-go (TUG) test. RESULTS:
               An anti-inflammatory diet and higher scores on a Traditional
               dietary pattern both predicted greater SMI ((B: -0.04 (95\%CI
               -0.08, -0.00) kg/m2) and (B: 0.12 (95\%CI 0.04, 0.20) kg/m2),
               respectively), while a pro-inflammatory diet predicted slower
               TUG (B: 0.11 (95\%CI 0.001, 0.21) sec) over the 15-year
               follow-up period. These associations remained significant
               following adjustment for confounding variables. There were no
               associations observed for other dietary exposures. CONCLUSION: A
               Traditional dietary pattern higher in vegetables, wholegrain
               cereals, and animal protein was associated with greater skeletal
               muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet, also rich in
               vegetables, fruit, and wholegrain cereals, was associated with
               greater skeletal muscle mass and better muscle function over 15
               years.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Surgery is the main modality of cure for solid
               cancers and was prioritised to continue during COVID-19
               outbreaks. This study aimed to identify immediate areas for
               system strengthening by comparing the delivery of elective
               cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in periods of
               lockdown versus light restriction. METHODS: This international,
               prospective, cohort study enrolled 20 006 adult ($\geq$18 years)
               patients from 466 hospitals in 61 countries with 15 cancer
               types, who had a decision for curative surgery during the
               COVID-19 pandemic and were followed up until the point of
               surgery or cessation of follow-up (Aug 31, 2020). Average
               national Oxford COVID-19 Stringency Index scores were calculated
               to define the government response to COVID-19 for each patient
               for the period they awaited surgery, and classified into light
               restrictions (index 60). The primary outcome was the
               non-operation rate (defined as the proportion of patients who
               did not undergo planned surgery). Cox proportional-hazards
               regression models were used to explore the associations between
               lockdowns and non-operation. Intervals from diagnosis to surgery
               were compared across COVID-19 government response index groups.
               This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04384926.
               FINDINGS: Of eligible patients awaiting surgery, 2003 (10·0\%)
               of 20 006 did not receive surgery after a median follow-up of 23
               weeks (IQR 16-30), all of whom had a COVID-19-related reason
               given for non-operation. Light restrictions were associated with
               a 0·6\% non-operation rate (26 of 4521), moderate lockdowns with
               a 5·5\% rate (201 of 3646; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·81, 95\%
               CI 0·77-0·84; p<0·0001), and full lockdowns with a 15·0\% rate
               (1775 of 11 827; HR 0·51, 0·50-0·53; p<0·0001). In sensitivity
               analyses, including adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 case notification
               rates, moderate lockdowns (HR 0·84, 95\% CI 0·80-0·88; p<0·001),
               and full lockdowns (0·57, 0·54-0·60; p<0·001), remained
               independently associated with non-operation. Surgery beyond 12
               weeks from diagnosis in patients without neoadjuvant therapy
               increased during lockdowns (374 [9·1\%] of 4521 in light
               restrictions, 317 [10·4\%] of 3646 in moderate lockdowns, 2001
               [23·8\%] of 11 827 in full lockdowns), although there were no
               differences in resectability rates observed with longer delays.
               INTERPRETATION: Cancer surgery systems worldwide were fragile to
               lockdowns, with one in seven patients who were in regions with
               full lockdowns not undergoing planned surgery and experiencing
               longer preoperative delays. Although short-term oncological
               outcomes were not compromised in those selected for surgery,
               delays and non-operations might lead to long-term reductions in
               survival. During current and future periods of societal
               restriction, the resilience of elective surgery systems requires
               strengthening, which might include protected elective surgical
               pathways and long-term investment in surge capacity for acute
               care during public health emergencies to protect elective staff
               and services. FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) can be transmitted from a
               donor to a recipient during allogeneic hematopoietic cell
               transplantation. Exclusion of candidate donors with CH is
               controversial since its impact on recipient outcomes and graft
               alloimmune function is uncertain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
               performed targeted error-corrected sequencing on samples from
               1,727 donors age 40 years or older and assessed the effect of
               donor CH on recipient clinical outcomes. We measured long-term
               engraftment of 102 donor clones and cytokine levels in 256
               recipients at 3 and 12 months after transplant. RESULTS: CH was
               present in 22.5\% of donors, with DNMT3A (14.6\%) and TET2
               (5.2\%) mutations being most common; 85\% of donor clones showed
               long-term engraftment in recipients after transplantation,
               including clones with a variant allele fraction < 0.01.
               DNMT3A-CH with a variant allele fraction $\geq$ 0.01, but not
               smaller clones, was associated with improved recipient overall
               (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; P = .042) and progression-free
               survival (HR, 0.72; P = .003) after adjustment for significant
               clinical variables. In patients who received calcineurin-based
               graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, donor DNMT3A-CH was
               associated with reduced relapse (subdistribution HR, 0.59; P =
               .014), increased chronic graft-versus-host disease
               (subdistribution HR, 1.36; P = .042), and higher
               interleukin-12p70 levels in recipients. No recipient of sole
               DNMT3A or TET2-CH developed donor cell leukemia (DCL). In seven
               of eight cases, DCL evolved from donor CH with rare TP53 or
               splicing factor mutations or from donors carrying germline DDX41
               mutations. CONCLUSION: Donor CH is closely associated with
               clinical outcomes in transplant recipients, with differential
               impact on graft alloimmune function and potential for leukemic
               transformation related to mutated gene and somatic clonal
               abundance. Donor DNMT3A-CH is associated with improved recipient
               survival because of reduced relapse risk and with an augmented
               network of inflammatory cytokines in recipients. Risk of DCL in
               allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is driven by
               somatic myelodysplastic syndrome-associated mutations or
               germline predisposition in donors.",

               during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. METHODS: This was a patient-level,
               comparative analysis of two, international prospective cohort
               studies: one before the pandemic (January-October 2019) and the
               second during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (local emergence of
               COVID-19 up to 19 April 2020). Both included patients undergoing
               elective resection of an intra-abdominal cancer with curative
               intent across five surgical oncology disciplines. Patient
               selection and rates of 30-day postoperative pulmonary
               complications were compared. The primary outcome was 30-day
               postoperative mortality. Mediation analysis using a
               natural-effects model was used to estimate the proportion of
               deaths during the pandemic attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
               RESULTS: This study included 7402 patients from 50 countries;
               3031 (40.9 per cent) underwent surgery before and 4371 (59.1 per
               cent) during the pandemic. Overall, 4.3 per cent (187 of 4371)
               developed postoperative SARS-CoV-2 in the pandemic cohort. The
               pulmonary complication rate was similar (7.1 per cent (216 of
               3031) versus 6.3 per cent (274 of 4371); P = 0.158) but the
               mortality rate was significantly higher (0.7 per cent (20 of
               3031) versus 2.0 per cent (87 of 4371); P < 0.001) among
               patients who had surgery during the pandemic. The adjusted odds
               of death were higher during than before the pandemic (odds ratio
               (OR) 2.72, 95 per cent c.i. 1.58 to 4.67; P < 0.001). In
               mediation analysis, 54.8 per cent of excess postoperative deaths
               during the pandemic were estimated to be attributable to
               SARS-CoV-2 (OR 1.73, 1.40 to 2.13; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION:
               Although providers may have selected patients with a lower risk
               profile for surgery during the pandemic, this did not mitigate
               the likelihood of death through SARS-CoV-2 infection. Care
