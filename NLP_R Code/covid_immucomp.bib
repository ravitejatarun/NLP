  abstract  = "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global
               pandemic which has induced unprecedented ramifications, severely
               affecting our society due to the long incubation time,
               unpredictably high prevalence and lack of effective vaccines.
               One of the interesting notions is that there is an association
               between COVID-19 and cancer. Cancer patients seem to exhibit
               exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality rate when exposed
               to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution to
               minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the
               new viral strains. However, there are still limitations to be
               considered, including the efficacy of COVID vaccines for
               immunocompromised individuals, possible interactions between the
               vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only to
               eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for
               immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a
               successful vaccine platform is required through the
               implementation of nanotechnology which can also enable scalable
               manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster
               and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current
               understanding of COVID-19 with clinical perspectives,
               highlighting the association between COVID-19 and cancer,
               followed by a vaccine development for this association using
               nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for
               the COVID-19 vaccine formulation options. This study will
               contribute to paving the way towards the prevention and

               (COVID-19) caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
               Convalescent plasma, a method of passive immunization that has
               been applied to prior viral pandemics, holds promise as a
               potential treatment for COVID-19. Immunocompromised patients may

               underlying deficits in B and T cell immunity as well as
               contraindications to antiviral and immunomodulatory therapy. We
               describe our institutional experience with four immunosuppressed
               patients (two kidney transplant recipients, one lung transplant

               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and review the published
               literature from Western countries. METHODS: Prospective study
               (March to May, 2020) that included all COVID-19 patients
               admitted to a tertiary hospital. Modified AspICU and European
               Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study
               Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria were used. RESULTS:
               COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in
               eight patients (3.3\% of 239 ICU patients), mostly affected
               non-immunocompromised patients (75\%) with severe acute
               respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receiving corticosteroids.
               Diagnosis was established after a median of 15 days under
               mechanical ventilation. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in
               two patients with positive Aspergillus fumigatus cultures and
               galactomannan (GM) index. Serum GM was positive in 4/8 (50\%).
               Thoracic CT scan findings fulfilled EORTC/MSG criteria in one
               case. Isavuconazole was used in 4/8 cases. CAPA-related
               mortality was 100\% (8/8). Compared with colonised patients,
               CAPA subjects were administered tocilizumab more often (100\%
               vs. 40\%, p = .04), underwent longer courses of antibacterial
               therapy (13 vs. 5 days, p = .008), and had a higher all-cause
               mortality (100\% vs. 40\%, p = .04). We reviewed 96 similar
               cases from recent publications: 59 probable CAPA (also putative
               according modified AspICU), 56 putative cases and 13
               colonisations according AspICU algorithm; according EORTC/MSG
               six proven and two probable. Overall, mortality in the reviewed
               series was 56.3\%. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-associated pulmonary

               order Nidovirales. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a positive-sense
               single-stranded RNA enveloped virus that includes spike proteins
               projecting from the envelope. The spike (S) protein interacts
               with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor,
               which plays a role in the viral entry into the cell. The
               SARS-CoV-2 virus is zoonotic; the wet animal market where live
               animals are sold is expected to be the source of infection. It
               is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
               Transmission of the virus among humans is confirmed by direct

               challenges to clinicians caring for patients with chronic liver
               disease. In the past 6 months, COVID-19 has led to over 150,000
               deaths in the United States and over 660,000 deaths around the
               world. Mounting evidence suggests that chronic liver diseases
               can have an adverse effect on the clinical outcomes of patients
               with COVID-19. We present a comprehensive review of the latest
               literature on preexisting liver diseases and its
               interrelationship with COVID-19 infection in cirrhosis,
               hepatocellular carcinoma, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,

               COVID-19 has highly variable disease severity and a bimodal
               course characterized by acute respiratory viral infection
               followed by hyperinflammation in a subset of patients with
               severe disease. This immune dysregulation is characterized by
               lymphocytopenia, elevated levels of plasma cytokines and
               proliferative and exhausted T cells, among other dysfunctional
               cell types. Immunocompromised persons often fare worse in the
               context of acute respiratory infections, but preliminary data
               suggest this may not hold true for COVID-19. In this review, we
               explore the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mortality in four
               populations with distinct forms of immunocompromise: (1) persons
               with hematological malignancies (HM) and hematopoietic stem cell
               transplant (HCT) recipients; (2) solid organ transplant
               recipients (SOTRs); (3) persons with rheumatological diseases;
               and (4) persons living with HIV (PLWH). For each population, key
               immunological defects are described and how these relate to the
               immune dysregulation in COVID-19. Next, outcomes including
               mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection are described for each
               population, giving comparisons to the general population of
               age-matched and comorbidity-matched controls. In these four
               populations, iatrogenic or disease-related immunosuppression is
               not clearly associated with poor prognosis in HM, HCT, SOTR,
               rheumatological diseases, or HIV. However, certain individual
               immunosuppressants or disease states may be associated with
               harmful or beneficial effects, including harm from severe CD4
               lymphocytopenia in PLWH and possible benefit to the calcineurin
               inhibitor ciclosporin in SOTRs, or tumor necrosis
               factor-$\alpha$ inhibitors in persons with rheumatic diseases.
               Lastly, insights gained from clinical and translational studies
               are explored as to the relevance for repurposing of
               immunosuppressive host-directed therapies for the treatment of
               hyperinflammation in COVID-19 in the general population.",

               transplant (LT) patients. METHODS: Multicenter nationwide cohort
               study of all LT recipients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 1
               to May 19, 2020. Recipient main characteristics and their
               management were retrieved. Hospitalization characteristics,
               occurrence of complications and survival were analyzed. RESULTS:
               Thirty-five LT patients with a COVID-19 infection were included.
               Median age was 50.4 (40.6-62.9) years, 16 (45.7\%) were female,
               and 80\% were double-LT recipients. Infection was
               community-acquired in 25 (71.4\%). Thirty-one (88.6\%) required
               hospitalization, including 13 (41.9\%) in the intensive care
               unit. The main symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and
               diarrhea, present in 71.4\%, 54.3\%, and 31.4\% of cases,
               respectively. Extension of pneumonia on chest CT was moderate to
               severe in 51.4\% of cases. Among the 13 critically ill patients,
               7 (53.9\%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Thrombotic
               events occurred in 4 patients. Overall survival rate was 85.7\%
               after a median follow-up of 50 days (41.0-56.5). Four of 5
               nonsurvivors had had bronchial complications or intensification
               of immunosuppression in the previous weeks. On univariate
               analysis, overweight was significantly associated with risk of

               dialysis patients appear to be at increased risk for infection
               due to viral transmission next to an enhanced risk for mortality
               as compared to the general population, even in the face of an
               often apparently mild clinical presentation. Derangements in the
               innate and adaptive immune systems may be responsible for a
               reduced antiviral response, whereas chronic activation of the
               innate immune system and endothelial dysfunction provide a
               background for a more severe course. The presence of severe
               comorbidity, older age, and a reduction of organ reserve may
               lead to a rapid deterioration of the clinical situation of the
               patients in case of severe infection. Secondly, patients with
               COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI),
               which is related to the severity of the clinical disease. The
               presence of AKI, and especially the need for renal replacement
               therapy (RRT), is associated with an increased risk of
               mortality. AKI in COVID-19 has a multifactorial origin, in which
               direct viral invasion of kidney cells, activation of the
               renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, a hyperinflammatory
               response, hypercoagulability, and nonspecific factors such as
               hypotension and hypoxemia may be involved. Apart from logistic
               challenges and the need for strict hygiene within units,
               treatment of patients with ESRD and COVID-19 is not different
               from that of the general population. Extracorporeal treatment of
               patients with AKI with RRT can be complicated by frequent filter
               clotting due to the hypercoagulable state, for which regional
               citrate coagulation provides a reasonable solution. Also, acute
               peritoneal dialysis may be a reasonable option in these
               patients. Whether adjuncts to extracorporeal therapies, such as
               hemoadsorption, provide additional benefits in the case of
               severely ill COVID-19 patients needs to be addressed in
               controlled studies.",

               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in immunocompromised patients has

               cell (HCT), and solid organ transplant (SOT) patients and
               compared their clinical data and outcomes to the general
               population. For adult CA, HCT and SOT patients, an extensive
               search strategy retrieved all articles published until July 20,
               2020 by combining the terms coronavirus, coronavirus infection,
               COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 in PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of

               Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines. For the
               pediatric CA cohort, a global COVID-19 registry was used. For
               the general population cohort, a large meta-analysis was used to
               compare pooled prevalence estimates, and two large meta-analyses
               were utilized to serve as pooled comparators for hospitalized
               COVID-19 patients. FINDINGS: Compared to the general population,
               adult CA and SOT patients with COVID-19 had higher
               comorbidities, greater levels of inflammatory markers at
               diagnosis, and higher rates of intensive care and hospital
               mortality. Pediatric CA patients and HCT patients with COVID-19
               tended to have clinical presentations and outcomes similar to
               the general population. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this
               is the first systematic review evaluating COVID-19 phenotype and
               outcomes in immunocompromised patients and comparing them to the
               general population, which shows that hospital outcomes appear to
               be worse in adult CA and SOT patients, potentially due to their

               has spread globally. Therapeutic options including antivirals,
               anti-inflammatory compounds, and vaccines are still under study.
               Convalescent plasma(CP) immunotherapy was an effective method
               for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV,
               and MERS-CoV. In the epidemic of COVID-19, a large number of
               literatures reported the application of CP. However, there is
               controversy over the efficacy of CP therapy for COVID-19. This
               systematic review was designed to evaluate the existing evidence
               and experience related to CP immunotherapy for COVID-19.
               METHODS: A literature search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane
               Library, Clinical Key, Wanfang Database; China National
               Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI) were used to search for the
               proper keywords such as SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, plasma, serum,
               immunoglobulins, blood transfusion, convalescent, novel
               coronavirus, immune and the related words for publications
               published until 15.10.2020. Other available resources were also
               used to identify relevant articles. The present systematic
               review was performed based on PRISMA protocol. Data extraction
               and risk of bias assessments were performed by two reviewers.
               RESULTS: Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 45
               articles were included in the final review. First, meta-analysis
               results of RCTs showed that, there were no statistically
               significant differences between CP transfusion and the control
               group in terms of reducing mortality(OR 0.79, 95\% CI 0.52-1.19,
               I2 = 28\%) and improving clinical symptoms(OR 1.21, 95\%CI
               0.68-2.16; I2 = 0\%). The results of controlled NRSIs showed
               that CP therapy may reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients(RR
               0.59, 95\% CI 0.53-0.66, I2 = 0\%). Second, limited safety data
               suggested that CP is a well-tolerated therapy with a low
               incidence of adverse events. But, due to lack of safety data for
               the control group, it is really not easy to determine whether CP
               transfusion has an impact on moderate to serious AEs. Thirdly,
               for children, pregnant, elderly, tumor and immunocompromised
               patients, CP may be a well-tolerated therapy, if the disease
               cannot be controlled and continues to progress. Studies were
               commonly of low or very low quality. CONCLUSIONS: Although the
               results of limited RCTs showed that CP cannot significantly
               reduce mortality, some non-RCTs and case report(series) have
               found that CP may help patients improve clinical symptoms, clear
               the virus, and reduce mortality, especially for patients with
               COVID-19 within ten days of illness. We speculate that CP may be
               a possible treatment option. High-quality studies are needed for
               establishing stronger quality of evidence and pharmacists should
               also be actively involved in the CP treatment process and
               provide close pharmaceutical care.",

               identifying COVID-19 associated sequelae, such as mental health

              COVID-19, and health anxiety measurements were collected by
              online surveys from June 15 to July 15, 2020. Univariate and
              multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify
              predictors. A total of 1,030 patients in 13 provinces in Saudi
              Arabia completed the questionnaire. A significant number of
              patients with chronic diseases experienced considerable levels of
              fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was found that
              21.44\% of participants met the criteria for anxiety cases, and
              19.4\% were considered borderline anxiety cases. In regression
              analysis, significant predictors of fear and health anxiety were
              female gender, lower education, middle-aged, divorced or widowed,
              receiving immunosuppressants, type of chronic disease (Crohn's

              infectious outbreaks to ensure their safety, to decrease the risk
              of infection and serious complications, and reduce their fear and
              health anxiety. Effective positive psychological interventions
              and support strategies also need to be immediately implemented to
              increase psychological resilience and improve the mental health
              of these patients. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, chronic disease

               syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is nascent. We sought to
               characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission within US households and
               estimate the household secondary infection rate (SIR) to inform
               strategies to reduce transmission. METHODS: We recruited
               patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and
               their household contacts in Utah and Wisconsin during 22 March
               2020-25 April 2020. We interviewed patients and all household
               contacts to obtain demographics and medical histories. At the
               initial household visit, 14 days later, and when a household
               contact became newly symptomatic, we collected respiratory swabs
               from patients and household contacts for testing by SARS-CoV-2
               real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
               (rRT-PCR) and sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing by
               enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We estimated SIR and
               odds ratios (ORs) to assess risk factors for secondary
               infection, defined by a positive rRT-PCR or ELISA test. RESULTS:
               Thirty-two (55\%) of 58 households secondary infection among
               household contacts. The SIR was 29\% (n = 55/188; 95\%
               confidence interval [CI], 23\%-36\%) overall, 42\% among
               children (aged <18 years) of the COVID-19 patient and 33\% among
               spouses/partners. Household contacts to COVID-19 patients with
               immunocompromised conditions and household contacts who
               themselves had diabetes mellitus had increased odds of infection
               with ORs 15.9 (95\% CI, 2.4-106.9) and 7.1 (95\% CI: 1.2-42.5),
               respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found substantial evidence of
               secondary infections among household contacts. People with
               COVID-19, particularly those with immunocompromising conditions
               or those with household contacts with diabetes, should take care

               Dhahran between March to August 2020 (6 months). All laboratory
               confirmed COVID-19 admitted cases were evaluated for their

               care unit [ICU]), and imaging findings (ground-glass opacity

               atelectasis, reticulation, peribronchovascular thickening,
               lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion) on chest radiograph (CXR)
               and computed tomography (CT) studies. Cavitation, nodularity,
               bronchiectasis, and embolism detected on CT scans were

               (radiographic regression or resolution of findings), worsening
               (shifting from ward to ICU), and unfavorable outcome (persistent
               ICU stay or death) were recorded. Imaging findings were

               reporting was made. Chi-square test was used to determine
               association. Results: Out of 106 patients, majority were males
               (n=82, 77.4\%). Forty-six patients (43.3\%) had abnormal imaging
               with mostly peripheral GGO (56.5\%), followed by consolidations
               (34.7\%), and others (26\%). Complications were detected in 6
               ICU patients. All patients with unfavorable outcomes were above
               60 years having comorbidities or complications (p less than
               0.0005). Fatality rate was calculated as 2.8. Conclusion:
               Coronavirus disease 2019 is seen mostly affecting males, with
               peripheral opacities as common imaging findings. Elderly
               patients with co-morbidities may show unfavorable outcomes.",

               uncertainties regarding disease management specific to
               immunocompromised patient populations. Despite over ~16 million
               confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of July 25, 2020, there
               is a dearth of reports describing the co-infection of Human

               unknowns regarding the simultaneous impact from these two

               acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are immunocompromised

               clinical symptoms, and poorer prognosis, from COVID-19. A large
               majority of reports indicate that HIV patients with normal CD4

               chronic antiretroviral therapy (cART) do not present with a

               hospital. The tacrolimus trough level was between 10 and 12
               ng/mL. After the diagnosis of COVID-19, MMF was stopped and the
               tacrolimus dose was reduced so that blood level was between 4

               positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain
               reaction (PCR), was collected. RESULTS: Of the 578 pediatric
               oncology patients tested for COVID-19, 98 were positive, of whom
               73 were symptomatic. Most experienced mild disease, 28 required
               inpatient management, 25 needed oxygen support, and seven
               required mechanical ventilation. There is a slightly higher risk
               of severe disease in males and obese patients, though not
               statistically significant. Persistent lymphopenia was noted in
               severe cases. Delays in cancer therapy occurred in 67\% of
               SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Of four deaths, none were solely
               attributable to COVID-19. The impact of the pandemic on
               pediatric oncology care was significant, with 54\% of
               institutions reporting delays in chemotherapy, 46\% delays in
               surgery, and 30\% delays in transplant. CONCLUSION: In this
               large multi-institutional cohort, we observed that mortality and
               morbidity from COVID-19 amongst pediatric oncology patients were
               low overall, but higher than reported in general pediatrics.
               Certain subgroups might be at higher risk of severe disease.
               Delays in cancer care due to SARS-CoV-2 remain a concern.",

               prevalence in pediatric immunocompromised patients remains
               unknown. METHODS: This cross-sectional study tested convenience
               samples from pediatric patients who had clinically indicated lab
               work collected and an immunocompromising condition, including
               oncologic diagnoses, solid organ transplant (SOT), bone marrow
               transplant, primary immunodeficiency, and rheumatologic
               conditions or inflammatory bowel disease on systemic
               immunosuppression, for the presence of antibodies to severe
               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS:
               We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2
               seroprevalence of 1.0\% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95\%:
               0.3\%-2.4\%). Two patients were positive by nasopharyngeal (NP)
               swab Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
               but only 1 seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or
               SOT were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting
               with respiratory illness as compared with other groups.
               CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in
               immunocompromised children was similar to that of an
               immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6\%, CI 95\%:
               0.3\%-1.1\%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However,
               none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via
               NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and 2 patients did
               not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may
               not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children,

              antiviral activity continue to expand such that updated guidance
              is needed regarding use of these agents in children. METHODS: A
              panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists
              from 20 geographically diverse North American institutions was
              convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based
              surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined
              based on review of the best available evidence and expert
              opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of COVID-19 in
              children, supportive care alone is suggested for most cases. For
              children with severe illness, defined as a supplemental oxygen
              requirement without need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical
              ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),
              remdesivir is suggested, preferably as part of a clinical trial
              if available. Remdesivir should also be considered for critically
              ill children requiring invasive or noninvasive mechanical
              ventilation or ECMO. A duration of 5 days is appropriate for most
              patients. The panel recommends against the use of
              hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir (or other protease
              inhibitors) for COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral
              therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of

               clinical aspects and features of infected employees. Of these 36
               close contacts, 9 employees of the LSCT-Unit were infected and

               Setting, and Participants: A US 21-site case-control analysis of
               4513 adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021,
               with 28-day outcome data on death and mechanical ventilation
               available for patients enrolled through July 14, 2021. Date of
               final follow-up was August 8, 2021. Exposures: COVID-19
               vaccination. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations were
               evaluated between prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for
               COVID-19, in which case patients were those hospitalized for
               COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an
               alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among
               patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls
               were COVID-19 patients with and without progression to death or
               mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were measured
               with multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among 4513
               patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8\%]
               women; 23.0\% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9\% Hispanic
               individuals, and 20.1\% with an immunocompromising condition),
               1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 were controls
               without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2\%
               (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for
               COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood
               of vaccination (cases, 15.8\%; controls, 54.8\%; adjusted OR,
               0.15; 95\% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced SARS-CoV-2
               Alpha (8.7\% vs 51.7\%; aOR, 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta
               variants (21.9\% vs 61.8\%; aOR, 0.14; 95\% CI, 0.10-0.21). This
               association was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2\% vs
               53.5\%; aOR, 0.10; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.13) than immunocompromised
               patients (40.1\% vs 58.8\%; aOR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.35-0.69) (P <
               .001) and weaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with
               BNT162b2 (5.8\% vs 11.5\%; aOR, 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.27-0.49) than
               with mRNA-1273 (1.9\% vs 8.3\%; aOR, 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.23)
               (P < .001). Among 1197 patients hospitalized with COVID-19,
               death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 was
               associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0\% vs
               24.7\%; aOR, 0.33; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.58). Conclusions and
               Relevance: Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was
               significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19
               hospitalization and disease progression to death or mechanical
               ventilation. These findings are consistent with risk reduction
               among vaccine breakthrough infections compared with absence of
               vaccination.",

               a new strain of virus in the Coronavirus family that has not
               been previously identified. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus,
               everyone is at risk of catching the Coronavirus disease 2019
               (Covid-19). No one has immunity to the virus. Despite this,
               misconceptions about specific groups of people who are immune to
               Covid-19 emerged with the onset of the pandemic. This paper
               explores South African communities' misconceptions about who is
               most vulnerable to Covid-19. A rapid qualitative assessment was
               conducted remotely in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western
               Cape provinces of South Africa. Recruitment of study
               participants took place through established relationships with
               civil society organizations and contacts made by researchers. In
               total, 60 key informant interviews and one focus group
               discussion was conducted. Atlas.ti.8 Windows was used to
               facilitate qualitative data analysis. The qualitative data was
               coded, and thematic analysis used to identify themes. The
               results show a high level of awareness and knowledge of the
               transmission and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Qualitative data
               revealed that there is awareness of elderly people and those
               with immunocompromised conditions being more vulnerable to
               catching Covid-19. However, misconceptions of being protected
               against the virus or having low or no risk were also evident in
               the data. We found that false information circulated on social
               media not only instigated confusion, fear and panic, but also
               contributed to the construction of misconceptions, othering and
               stigmatizing responses to Covid-19. The study findings bring
               attention to the importance of developing communication
               materials adapted to specific communities to help reduce
               misconceptions, othering and stigmatization around Covid-19.",

  abstract  = "The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has changed the habits and lives of
               people worldwide. Patients affected by systemic sclerosis (SSc)
               experienced constant fear because of their immunocompromised
               status. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence
               of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to analyze the lifestyle changes in
               a single-center cohort of SSc patients and if these changes were
               more severe than in the general population. During the Italian
               lockdown, we supplied two surveys to our 184 SSc patients. In
               the first one, filled by 110 patients, we asked if SARS-CoV-2
               had infected them or if they experienced signs and symptoms
               consistent with COVID-19. The second survey, performed by 79 SSc
               patients and 63 healthy subjects, included questions about the
               lifestyle adopted during this specific period. Among our
               patients, COVID-19 was diagnosed only in one case, while three
               other subjects reported signs and symptoms suggestive for the
               disease. Regarding the second survey, our patients greatly
               changed their lifestyle during the pandemic, adopting more
               restrictive isolation measures, because of their awareness of
               frailty. To date, we do not dispose of enough data to speculate
               about the risk of COVID-19 among immunocompromised patients,
               although in our SSc patients their frailty seems to have been
               their shelter. Pending more accurate epidemiological studies, it
               is essential to share as much data as possible to better
               understand the impact of COVID-19 on SSc patients' health. Key
               points • The lifestyle adopted by SSc patients during the first
               months of COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by more stringent
               isolation rules than general population. • The prudential
               behavior of patients with SSc during Italian lockdown should be
               considered as a possible bias when analyzing the risk of

               illnesses in the majority of patients, but a critical illness
               can be seen in 5\% of cases - especially in the elderly
               population or in patients with multiple comorbidities. When
               COVID-19 is severe, it can cause pneumonia and hypoxemic
               respiratory failure, and can progress to viremia involving
               multiple organ systems. It causes significant cytopenia, mainly
               severe lymphopenia, and excessive exhaustion of CD8+ T cells,
               resulting in an immunocompromised state and cytokine storm.
               Furthermore, COVID-19 can commonly be complicated with acute
               thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism, acute
               stroke, acute myocardial infarction, clotting of hemodialysis

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Several vaccine candidates have been developed
               using different platforms, including nucleic acids (DNA and
               RNA), viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating),
               virus-like particles, peptide-based, recombinant proteins, live
               attenuated, and inactivated virus modalities. Although many of
               these vaccines are undergoing pre-clinical trials, several large
               clinical trials investigating the clinical efficacy and safety
               of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have produced
               promising findings. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we provide a
               status update on COVID-19 vaccines currently undergoing clinical
               trials and discuss issues of concern beyond vaccine efficacy and
               safety, including dosing regimens, the mixed vaccine strategy,
               prior severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection,
               antibody levels, cellular immunity and protection, variants of
               concern, COVID-19 vaccine distribution, vaccination willingness,
               herd immunity, immunity passports, and vaccine indications.
               EXPERT OPINION: Four vaccines have obtained emergency use
               authorization, 87 are at the clinical development stage, and 186
               are in pre-clinical development. While the knowledge and
               development of COVID-19 vaccines is rapidly expanding, the
               benefits of COVID-19 vaccines must outweigh the potential risks
               of adverse events. To combat the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians
               should consistently update COVID-19-associated information, and
               healthcare authorities and manufacturers should work together to
               provide adequate and appropriate vaccinations for the prevention
               of COVID-19. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: What is the context?Severe
               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a
               global pandemic: the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
               outbreak. The development and implementation of the COVID-19
               vaccine could be an important measure to control the COVID-19
               pandemic.What is new?Several phase 3 clinical trials have
               demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines
               for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Several COVID-19
               vaccines have obtained emergency use authorization and been
               implemented in many countries. Although concerns regarding
               unusual blood clots and low platelet counts have been raised,
               the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the potential risks
               of adverse events.What is the impact?Except for children, the
               COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for all people, including those
               pregnant or immunocompromised. Healthcare authorities should
               advise people receiving the vaccine that they must seek medical
               attention if they have associated thromboembolism and
               thrombocytopenia symptoms. More studies are necessary to
               determine the appropriate vaccine dose and regimen strategy, as
               well as the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against variants
               of concerns. A global effort must be made to achieve widespread
               vaccination and herd immunity.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Given the rapid increased in confirmed coronavirus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related mortality, it is important
               to identify vulnerable patients. Immunocompromised status is
               considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. We
               aimed to determine whether immunocompromised patients with
               COVID-19 have an increased risk of mortality. METHOD: The
               groups' baseline characteristics were balanced using a
               propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment
               weighting approach. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95\% confidence
               intervals (CIs) were calculated for the risks of in-hospital
               mortality and other outcomes according to immunocompromised
               status using a multivariable logistic regression model. We
               identified immunocompromised status based on a diagnosis of
               malignancy or HIV/AIDS, having undergone organ transplantation
               within 3 years, prescriptions for corticosteroids or oral
               immunosuppressants for $\geq$30 days, and at least one
               prescription for non-oral immunosuppressants during the last
               year. RESULTS: The 6,435 COVID-19 patients ($\geq$18 years)
               included 871 immunocompromised (13.5\%) and 5,564
               non-immunocompromised (86.5\%). Immunocompromised COVID-19
               patients were older (60.1$\pm$16.4 years vs. 47.1$\pm$18.7
               years, absolute standardized mean difference: 0.738). The
               immunocompromised group had more comorbidities, a higher
               Charlson comorbidity index, and a higher in-hospital mortality
               rate (9.6\% vs. 2.3\%; p < .001). The immunocompromised group
               still had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality rate

               different countries, several populations such as patients with
               specific immunological conditions have been considered as the
               priorities for immunization. In this regard, patients with
               autoimmune diseases or those receiving immunosuppressive agents
               and anti-cancer therapies, need special attention. However, no
               confirmed data is presently available regarding COVID-19
               vaccines in these populations due to exclusion from the
               conducted clinical trials. Given the probable suppression or
               over-activation of the immune system in such patients, reaching
               a consensus for their vaccination is critical, besides gathering
               data and conducting trials, which could probably clarify this
               matter in the future. In this review, besides a brief on the
               available COVID-19 vaccines, considerations and available
               knowledge about administering similar vaccines in patients with
               cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ

               discussed, live-attenuated viruses, which should be avoided in
               these groups, are not employed in the present COVID-19 vaccines.
               Thus, the main concern regarding efficacy could be met using a
               potent COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, the vaccination timing for
               maximum efficacy could be decided according to the patient's
               condition, indicated medications, and the guides provided here.
               Post-vaccination monitoring is also advised to ensure an
               adequate immune response. Further studies in this area are

               using PubMed to find MEDLINE indexed articles relevant to this
               study. As of 25 November 2020, the search has been conducted by
               combining the MeSH words ``COVID-19'' and ``Influenza''.
               RESULTS: Eighteen articles were finally selected in adult
               patients. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases,
               diabetes, and obesity were significantly higher in COVID-19
               patients, while pulmonary diseases and immunocompromised
               conditions were significantly more common in influenza patients.
               The incidence rates of fever, vomiting, ocular and
               otorhinolaryngological symptoms were found to be significantly
               higher in influenza patients when compared with COVID-19
               patients. However, neurologic symptoms and diarrhea were
               statistically more frequent in COVID-19 patients. The level of
               white cell count and procalcitonin was significantly higher in
               influenza patients, whereas thrombopenia and elevated
               transaminases were significantly more common in COVID-19
               patients. Ground-grass opacities, interlobular septal
               thickening, and a peripheral distribution were more common in
               COVID-19 patients than in influenza patients where

               antibody sensitivity. RESULTS: Both assays demonstrated 100\%

               $\geq$14 days and 94.8\% at $\geq$21 days, and the overall
               sensitivity of the Abbott was 94.4\% at $\geq$14 days and 98.2\%

               medications such as steroids and most importantly their advanced

               consistently been reported to suffer from an increased risk of

               increased specific pressures on respiratory healthcare services

               patients with lung cancer during the pandemic has become a
               continuous challenge over the last year. Deciding whether to
               offer, modify, postpone or even cancel treatments for this
               particular patient's population has become the crucial recurrent

               the short-term and long-term consequences of delaying cancer
               care. Despite the rapid and persistent trend of the pandemic,
               declared by WHO on March 11, 2020, and still ongoing at the time
               of writing (January 2021), various efforts were made by
               oncologists worldwide to understand the impact of COVID-19 on
               patients with cancer. Adapted recommendations of our
               evidence-based practice guidelines have been developed for all
               stakeholders. Different small and large-scale registries, such
               as the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) and Thoracic
               Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration quickly collected
               data, supporting cancer care decisions under the challenging
               circumstance created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several

               clinical characteristics and outcomes of ECMO between COVID-19
               and influenza. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Cochrane
               Library, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases from inception to
               May 1, 2021. The included studies compared the clinical
               characteristics and outcomes of ECMO between adults with
               COVID-19 and those with influenza. RESULTS: The study included
               four retrospective cohorts involving a total of 129 patients
               with COVID-19 and 140 with influenza who were treated using
               ECMO. Clinical characteristics were similar between the COVID-19
               and influenza groups, including body mass index (BMI), diabetes
               mellitus, hypertension, and immunocompromised status. A higher
               proportion of patients with COVID-19 on ECMO were male (75.9\%
               vs. 62.9\%; P = 0.04). There was no difference between the
               groups in terms of illness severity based on sequential organ
               failure assessment (SOFA) score or serum pH. Patients with
               COVID-19 had a longer mean duration of mechanical ventilation
               before ECMO (6.63 vs. 3.38 days; P < 0.01). The pooled mortality
               rate was 43.8\%. The mean ECMO duration (14.13 vs. 12.55 days; P
               = 0.25) and mortality rate (42.6\% vs. 45.0\%; P = 0.99) were

               characteristics, ECMO duration, and mortality were comparable
               between patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza who
               required ECMO to treat refractory hypoxemia. The duration of
               mechanical ventilation before ECMO did not influence outcomes.

               assays. Antibody response was detected at similar levels in IC
               and TX patients. Anti-Spike IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies
               persisted for at least one year, while anti-Nucleocapsid IgG
               declined earlier. Patients with pneumonia developed higher
               antibody levels than patients with mild symptoms. Similarly,
               both rapid and proliferative T-cell responses were detected
               within the first two months after infection at comparable levels
               in IC and TX patients, and were higher in patients with
               pneumonia. T-cell response persisted for at least one year in
               both IC and TX patients. Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid
               proteins elicited the major CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses,
               whereas the T-cell response to Envelope protein was negligible.
               After SARS-CoV-2 infection, antibody and T-cell responses
               develop rapidly and persist over time in both immunocompetent
               and transplanted patients.",

               global health crisis causing major challenges for clinical care
               in patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Although triggering
               of anti-viral immune responses is essential for clearance of
               infection, some patients have severe lung inflammation and
               multiorgan failure due to marked immune cell dysregulation and
               cytokine storm syndrome. Importantly, the activation of
               cytotoxic follicular helper T cells and a reduction of
               regulatory T cells have a crucial, negative prognostic role.
               These findings lead to the question of whether immunosuppressive
               and biologic therapies for gastrointestinal diseases affect the
               incidence or prognosis of COVID-19 and, thus, whether they
               should be adjusted to prevent or affect the course of the
               disease. In this Review, data on the use of such therapies are
               discussed with a primary focus on inflammatory bowel disease,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global
               health emergency. Despite the widely hypothesized role of a
               cytokine storm in disease severity, no study thus far has
               explored the association between immunosuppression and disease
               severity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This
               study aimed to examine the association between the use of
               immunosuppressant medication and outcomes of patients
               hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Nine hundred and eighty-one
               consecutive patients hospitalized between 12 March 2020 and 15
               April 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were enrolled in this
               cohort study and subdivided by immunosuppression status. The
               patients were followed up for a minimum of 28 days (median 37
               days) for the primary end-point of mortality. Secondary
               end-points included the composite of intubation or death, and
               the composite of mortality, intubation or continuous positive
               airway pressure (CPAP) requirement. RESULTS: During the
               follow-up period, 354 (36.1\%) of study patients died. The
               immunosuppressed cohort (n = 31) had significantly higher
               mortality rates (aHR: 2.067, 95\% CI: 1.20-3.57, P = 0.009).
               There was no association between immunosuppression and the
               composite end-point of mortality or intubation (aHR: 1.49 95\%
               CI: 0.88-2.51, P = 0.14) and of the composite end-point of
               mortality, intubation or CPAP (aHR: 1.36 95\% CI: 0.81-2.30 P =
               0.245). CONCLUSION: In this cohort study of 981 confirmed
               COVID-19 patients consecutively hospitalized at a large North
               West London hospital, immunosuppressant use was associated with
               significantly higher mortality rates. These results support the
               current UK government's early isolation ('shielding') policy for
               these individuals and should be used to guide future research.",

               hospitalization (mean [SD], 25.9 days [26.6 days] vs 17.2 days
               [21.0 days]; P = 0.002), a more frequent need for oxygen therapy
               (101 [60.8\%] vs 103 [40.4\%]; P < 0.001) and invasive
               ventilation (52 [31.3\%] vs 32 [12.5\%]; P < 0.001) and were
               more frequently admitted to the intensive care unit (70 [42.2\%]
               vs 51 [20.0\%]; P < 0.001) than seasonal influenza patients.
               Among immunocompromised patients, those in the COVID-19 group
               had a higher hospital mortality compared to those in the
               seasonal influenza group (13 [33.3\%] vs 8 [11.6\%], P = 0.01).
               In conclusion, we show that COVID-19 patients were younger and
               had fewer baseline comorbidities than seasonal influenza
               patients but were at increased risk for severe illness. The high
               mortality observed in immunocompromised COVID-19 patients

               SARS-CoV-2 has emerged in Wuhan, China, causing within 2 months
               a pandemic with the highest disease burden in elderly and people
               with pre-existing medical conditions. The pandemic has
               highlighted that new and more flexible clinical trial
               approaches, such as trial platforms, are needed to assess the
               efficacy and safety of interventions in a timely manner. The two
               existing Swiss cohorts of immunocompromised patients (i.e.,
               Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and Swiss Transplant Cohort Study
               (STCS)) are an ideal foundation to set-up a trial platform in
               Switzerland leveraging routinely collected data. Within a newly
               founded trial platform, we plan to assess the efficacy of the
               first two mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that reached market
               authorization in Switzerland in the frame of a pilot randomized
               controlled trial (RCT) while at the same time assessing the
               functionality of the trial platform. METHODS: We will conduct a
               multicenter randomized controlled, open-label, 2-arm sub-study
               pilot trial of a platform trial nested into two Swiss cohorts.
               Patients included in the SHCS or the STCS will be eligible for
               randomization to either receiving the mRNA vaccine
               Comirnaty\textregistered{} (Pfizer/BioNTech) or the COVID-19
               mRNA Vaccine Moderna\textregistered{}. The primary clinical
               outcome will be change in pan-lg antibody response (pan-Ig
               anti-S1-RBD; baseline vs. 3 months after first vaccination;
               binary outcome, considering $\geq$ 0.8 units/ml as a positive
               antibody response). The pilot study will also enable us to
               assess endpoints related to trial conduct feasibility (i.e.,
               duration of RCT set-up; time of patient recruitment; patient
               consent rate; proportion of missing data). Assuming vaccine
               reactivity of 90\% in both vaccine groups, we power our trial,
               using a non-inferiority margin such that a 95\% two-sided
               confidence interval excludes a difference in favor of the
               reference group of more than 10\%. A sample size of 380 (190 in
               each treatment arm) is required for a statistical power of 90\%
               and a type I error of 0.025. The study is funded by the Swiss
               National Science Foundation (National Research Program NRP 78,
               ``COVID-19''). DISCUSSION: This study will provide crucial
               information about the efficacy and safety of the mRNA SARS-CoV-2
               vaccines in HIV patients and organ transplant recipients.
               Furthermore, this project has the potential to pave the way for
               further platform trials in Switzerland. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

               because of the medication they receive to prevent rejection, and
               as a consequence are susceptible to (respiratory) infections.
               Adequate vaccination strategies, including COVID-19 vaccination,
               are therefore needed to minimize infection risks. AREAS COVERED:
               The international vaccination guidelines for lung transplant
               patients are reviewed, including the data on immunogenicity and
               effectivity of the vaccines. The impact on response to
               vaccination of the various categories of immunosuppressive
               drugs, used in the posttransplant period, on response to
               vaccination is described. A number of immunosuppressive and/or
               anti-inflammatory drugs also is used for controlling the
               immunopathology of severe COVID-19. Current available COVID-19
               vaccines, both mRNA or adenovirus based are recommended for lung
               transplant patients. EXPERT OPINION: In order to improve
               survival and quality of life, infections of lung transplant
               patients should be prevented by vaccination. When possible,
               vaccination should start already during the pre-transplantation
               period when the patient is on the waiting list. Booster
               vaccinations should be given post-transplantation, but only when
               immunosuppression has been tapered. Vaccine design based on mRNA
               technology could allow the design of an array of vaccines
               against other respiratory viruses, offering a better protection

               solid cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized in
               Shariati hospital between 20 February and 20 April 2020, were
               evaluated. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on
               laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and/or features of chest CT scan
               highly suggestive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 33
               COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included. Mean age was
               63.9 years, and 54.5\% of the patients were male. LDH level was

               kidney transplant population.Methods. A systematic review of
               articles that examined COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients
               was performed. Patients' demographics, clinical, laboratory and
               radiological presentations, immunosuppression modification, and
               COVID-19 specific management were abstracted and analyzed.
               COVID-19 severity was classified into mild, moderate, and
               severe. Disease outcome was classified by whether the patient
               was discharged, still hospitalized, or died.Results. 44 articles
               reporting individual data and 13 articles reporting aggregated
               data on 149 and 561 kidney transplant recipients respectively
               with COVID-19 from Asia, Europe and America fulfilled all
               inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among studies reporting case
               specific data, 76\% of cases had severe disease. Compared to
               patients with mild/moderate disease, patients with severe
               disease had higher CRP, LDH, Ferritin, D-dimer and were more
               likely to have bilateral lung involvement at presentation and
               longer time since transplantation (P < 0.05 for all).
               Recipients' age, gender and comorbidities did not impact disease
               severity. Patients with severe disease had a more aggressive CNI
               reduction and more antiviral medications utilization. Outcome
               was reported on 145 cases, of those 34 (23\%) died all with
               severe disease. Longer duration from transplant to disease
               diagnosis, hypoxia and higher LDH were associated with mortality
               (P < 0.05). Different immunosuppression reduction strategies,
               high dose parenteral corticosteroids use and various antiviral
               combinations did not demonstrate survival advantage. Similar
               finding was observed for studies reporting aggregated
               data.Conclusion. COVID-19 in kidney transplant patients is
               associated with high rate of disease severity and fatality.
               Higher LDH and longer time since transplantation predicted both
               disease severity and mortality. None of the COVID-19 specific
               treatment correlated with, or improved disease outcome in kidney
               transplant recipients.",

               DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Optum
               de-identified electronic health records including over 700
               hospitals and 7000 clinics in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: There were
               891 754 patients who had a COVID-19 test identified in their
               electronic health record between 20 February 2020 and 10 July
               2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Per cent of viral
               and antibody tests positive for COVID-19 ('positivity rate');
               adjusted ORs for factors associated with COVID-19 viral and
               antibody test positivity; and per cent concordance between
               positive viral and subsequent antibody test results. RESULTS:
               Overall positivity rate was 9\% (70 472 of 771 278) and 12\% (11
               094 of 91 741) for viral and antibody tests, respectively.
               Positivity rate was inversely associated with the number of
               individuals tested and decreased over time across regions and
               race/ethnicities. Antibody test concordance among patients with
               an initial positive viral test was 91\% (71\%-95\% depending on
               time between tests). Among tests separated by at least 2 weeks,
               discordant results occurred in 7\% of patients and 9\% of
               immunocompromised patients. Factors associated with increased
               odds of viral and antibody positivity in multivariable models
               included: male sex, Hispanic or non-Hispanic black or Asian
               race/ethnicity, uninsured or Medicaid insurance and Northeast
               residence. We identified a negative dose effect between the
               number of comorbidities and viral and antibody test positivity.
               Paediatric patients had reduced odds (OR=0.60, 95\% CI 0.57 to
               0.64) of a positive viral test but increased odds (OR=1.90, 95\%
               CI 1.62 to 2.23) of a positive antibody test compared with those
               aged 18-34 years old. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified
               sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19

               bacterial infections but usually occur in the more severely
               burned patients and have been associated with poor outcomes.
               Methods: Retrospective reviews and case series were examined to
               provide an overview of the management of viral infections in the
               burn patient. Results: The most common viral pathogens in these
               patients are the herpesviruses, which include herpes simplex,
               varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6.
               Established viral infections that may complicate patient
               management include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and
               C, and, more recently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
               Herpesvirus infections can occur as primary or nosocomial
               pathogens but clinical manifestations most commonly are
               re-activation of latent viral infection. Because of the paucity
               of data in the burn population, much of the evidence for
               specific treatments is extrapolated from patients with severe
               immunosuppression or critical illness. Antiviral therapy is
               employed for the burn patient with herpesvirus infections. This
               is an area of active study, and further research is needed to
               better understand the risks, clinical manifestations, and
               attributable morbidity and mortality of viral infections.
               Conclusions: Major burn injury results in immunosuppression and
               viral infection in a small number of patients. Recognition and
               antiviral therapy are employed, but additional studies are
               necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.",

               zero-covid and herd immunity. Between the two, often oscillating
               measures, based on medical but also societal and political
               considerations, have been taken without any major effect on the
               course of the epidemic. Vaccines are a game-changer by providing
               a real opportunity to sustainably protect everyone against
               infection and eliminate the circulation of the virus. The
               Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, the three currently
               authorized in France, overall induce remarkable protection rates
               of 95 \%, 94 \% and 70 \% respectively. The surprise came from
               that this efficacy was obtained after a rapid development, by
               targeting only the viral protein S as antigen, and by using the
               administration of expression vectors innovative in vaccinology,

               non-White race; age greater than 4 years; and obesity/type 2 DM,
               cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and pulmonary conditions.
               CONCLUSIONS: Among children and adolescents presenting to US
               children's hospital EDs with COVID-19, 20\% were hospitalized;
               of these, 21\% received care in the ICU. Older children and
               adolescents had a lower risk for hospitalization but more severe
               illness when hospitalized. There were differences in disease
               severity by race and ethnicity and the presence of selected
               comorbidities. These factors should be taken into consideration
               when prioritizing mitigation and vaccination strategies.",

               virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines may provide prompt, effective, and
               safe solution for the COVID-19 pandemic. Several vaccine
               candidates have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials
               (RCTs). Furthermore, data from observational studies mimicking
               real-life practice and studies on specific groups, such as
               pregnant women or immunocompromised patients who were excluded
               from RCTs, are currently available. The main aim of the review
               is to summarize and provide an immunologist's view on mechanism
               of action, efficacy and safety, and future challenges in
               vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. RECENT FINDINGS: mRNA and
               recombinant viral vector-based vaccines have been approved for
               conditional use in Europe and the USA. They show robust humoral
               and cellular responses, high with efficacy in prevention of
               COVID-19 infection (66.9 95\%) and favorable safety profile in
               RCTs. High efficacy of 80-92\% was observed in real-life
               practice. A pilot study also confirmed good safety profile of
               the mRNA vaccines in pregnant women. Unlike in those with
               secondary immunodeficiencies where postvaccination responses did
               not occur, encouraging results were obtained in patients with
               inborn errors of immunity. SUMMARY: Although both RCTs and
               observational studies suggest good efficacy and safety profiles
               of the vaccines, their long-term efficacy and safety are still
               being discussed. Despite the promising results, clinical
               evidence for specific groups such as children, pregnant and
               breastfeeding women, and immunocompromised patients, and for
               novel virus variants are lacking. VIDEO ABSTRACT:

               is rapidly spreading and has resulted in grievous morbidity and
               mortality worldwide. Despite the high infectiousness of
               SARS-CoV-2, the majority of infected individuals are
               asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and could eventually recover
               as a result of their balanced immune function. On the contrary,
               immuno-compromised patients are prone to progress into severe or

               (COVID-19) pandemic is profound, with distressing consequences
               on many individuals, especially those with co-morbidities.
               Pregnant women are one such group of individuals who are at in
               increased risk of contracting COVID-19, due to their
               immunocompromised state. In South Africa, HIV infection and
               pre-eclampsia are the leading causes of maternal morbidity and
               mortality, with South Africa being the HIV epicentre of the
               world. The relationship between COVID-19 superimposed on HIV
               infection and preeclampsia is complex and uncertain due to their
               different immune responses, and therefore requires further
               research. RECENT FINDINGS: Notably evidence suggests that
               pregnant women with chronic comorbidities (HIV and
               pre-eclampsia) may be at a greater risk of contracting or
               encountering complications from COVID-19. Maternal stress,
               during a pandemic, as well as home delivery have become
               potential options for pregnant woman. Nonetheless there is
               currently a paucity of information on the combined effect of
               COVID-19 in HIV-associated preeclampsia. Understanding the
               pathogenesis of COVID-19 could potentially aid in developing

               therapy, RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 transplant patients were able
               to mount vigorous antiviral T cell and antibody responses, as
               efficiently as two nontherapeutically immunosuppressed COVID-19
               patients on hemodialysis. By contrast, six RT-PCR-negative

               showed very low numbers of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells, whereas

               to SARS-CoV-2 were also detected in seronegative healthy

               suggest that during COVID-19, monitoring both T cell and
               serological immunity might be helpful for the differential
               diagnosis of COVID-19 but are also needed to evaluate a

               level of protection from COVID-19 mRNA vaccines as do

               with COVID-19-like illness from 187 hospitals in nine states

               immunocompromised adults (10,564 [53\%] of whom were fully
               vaccinated) and 69,116 immunocompetent adults (29,456 [43\%] of
               whom were fully vaccinated). VE of 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19

               2019 (COVID-19) have prolonged infectious viral shedding for
               more than 20 days. A test-based approach is suggested for
               de-isolation of these patients. METHODS: The strategy was
               evaluated by comparing severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load (cycle threshold (Ct)
               values) and viral culture at the time of hospital discharge in a
               series of 13 COVID-19 patients: six immunocompetent and seven
               immunocompromised (five solid organ transplant patients, one
               lymphoma patient, and one hepatocellular carcinoma patient).
               RESULTS: Three of the 13 (23\%) patients had positive viral
               cultures: one patient with lymphoma (on day 16) and two
               immunocompetent patients (on day 7 and day 11). Eighty percent
               of the patients had negative viral cultures and had a mean Ct
               value of 20.5. None of the solid organ transplant recipients had
               positive viral cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The mean Ct value for
               negative viral cultures was 20.5 in this case series of
               immunocompromised patients. Unlike those with hematological
               malignancies, none of the solid organ transplant patients had
               positive viral cultures. Adopting the test-based approach for
               all immunocompromised patients may lead to prolonged quarantine.
               Large-scale studies in disease-specific populations are needed

               were solid malignancy (32.0\%), kidney disease (19.5\%), and
               rheumatologic/inflammatory conditions (16.7\%). Among the fully
               vaccinated IC and non-IC cohorts, a total of 978 breakthrough
               infections were observed during the study period; 124 (12.7\%)
               resulted in hospitalization and 2 (0.2\%) were inpatient deaths.
               IC individuals accounted for 38.2\% (N = 374) of all
               breakthrough infections, 59.7\% (N = 74) of all
               hospitalizations, and 100\% (N = 2) of inpatient deaths. The
               proportion with breakthrough infections was 3 times higher in
               the IC cohort compared to the non-IC cohort (N = 374 [0.18\%]
               vs. N = 604 [0.06\%]; unadjusted incidence rates were 0.89 and
               0.34 per 100 person-years, respectively. Organ transplant
               recipients had the highest incidence rate; those with >1 IC
               condition, antimetabolite usage, primary immunodeficiencies, and
               hematologic malignancies also had higher incidence rates
               compared to the overall IC cohort. Incidence rates in older
               ($\geq$65 years old) IC individuals were generally higher versus
               younger IC individuals (<65). LIMITATIONS: This retrospective
               analysis relied on coding accuracy and had limited capture of
               COVID-19 vaccine receipt. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine
               breakthrough infections are rare but are more common and severe
               in IC individuals. The findings from this large study support
               the FDA authorization and CDC recommendations to offer a 3rd
               vaccine dose to increase protection among IC individuals.",

               and many countries have been suffering from a large number of
               deaths. Acknowledging the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate into
               distinct strains as an RNA virus and investigating its potential
               to cause reinfection is important for future health policy
               guidelines. It was thought that individuals who recovered from
               COVID-19 generate a robust immune response and develop
               protective immunity; however, since the first case of documented
               reinfection of COVID-19 in August 2020, there have been a number
               of cases with reinfection. Many cases are lacking genomic data
               of the two infections, and it remains unclear whether they were
               caused by different strains. In the present study, we undertook
               a rapid systematic review to identify cases infected with
               different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR and
               viral genome sequencing. A total of 17 cases of genetically
               confirmed COVID-19 reinfection were found. One immunocompromised
               patient had mild symptoms with the first infection but developed
               severe symptoms resulting in death with the second infection.
               Overall, 68.8\% (11/16) had similar severity; 18.8\% (3/16) had
               worse symptoms; and 12.5\% (2/16) had milder symptoms with the
               second episode. Our case series shows that reinfection with
               different strains is possible, and some cases may experience
               more severe infections with the second episode. The findings
               also suggest that COVID-19 may continue to circulate even after
               achieving herd immunity through natural infection or
               vaccination, suggesting the need for longer-term transmission

               COVID-19 symptoms may evolve by virtue of hyperactivation of the
               immune system. Equally, immunocompromised patients may be at
               increased risk to develop COVID-19. However, treatment
               guidelines for children following liver transplantation are
               elusive. METHODS: As a liver transplantation center, we
               diagnosed and followed up 10 children (male/female: 8/2) with a
               median age of 8.5 years (IQR: 5.2-11.0), with COVID-19
               post-liver transplant between March 2019 and December 2020.
               COVID-19 diagnosis was based on PCR test and or florid X-ray
               findings compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of other cause.
               We retrospectively collected clinical and laboratory data from
               electronic patient records following written consent from
               patients/parents. RESULTS: Nine patients were diagnosed as
               definitive (PCR positive) with one patient being diagnosed as
               probable COVID-19. Seven patients recovered without any support
               whereas three were admitted for non-invasive oxygenation.
               Lymphopenia and/or high levels of serum IL-6 were detected in
               four patients. Six patients mounted anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
               at median 30 days (IQR: 26.5-119.0) following COVID-19
               diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy, favipiravir, anakinra, and IVIG
               were used as treatment in 4,1,1 and 2 patients, respectively.
               Furthermore, we kept the tacrolimus with or without everolimus
               but stopped MMF in 2 patients. Importantly, liver allograft
               function was retained in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found
               that being immunocompromised did not affect disease severity nor
               survival. Stopping MMF yet continuing with tacrolimus was an apt

               Due to the rampant rise in the number of cases in China and
               globally, WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March
               2020. The disease is transmitted via respiratory droplets of
               infected patients during coughing or sneezing and affects
               primarily the lung parenchyma. The spectrum of clinical
               manifestations can be seen in COVID-19 patients ranging from
               asymptomatic infections to severe disease resulting in
               mortality. Although respiratory involvement is most common in
               COVID-19 patients, the virus can affect other organ systems as
               well. The systemic inflammation induced by the disease along
               with multisystem expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2
               (ACE2), a receptor which allows viral entry into cells, explains

               musculoskeletal, and endocrine system. Here, we have reviewed

               COVID-19 vaccinations increase protection (1-3). During
               August-November 2021, a series of Emergency Use Authorizations
               and recommendations, including those for an additional primary
               dose for immunocompromised persons and a booster dose for
               persons aged $\geq$18 years, were approved because of reduced
               immunogenicity in immunocompromised persons, waning vaccine
               effectiveness over time, and the introduction of the highly
               transmissible B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant (4,5). Adults aged
               $\geq$65 years are at increased risk for COVID-19-associated
               hospitalization and death and were one of the populations first
               recommended a booster dose in the U.S. (5,6). Data on COVID-19
               vaccinations reported to CDC from 50 states, the District of
               Columbia (DC), and eight territories and freely associated
               states were analyzed to ascertain coverage with booster or
               additional primary doses among adults aged $\geq$65 years.
               During August 13-November 19, 2021, 18.7 million persons aged
               $\geq$65 years received a booster or additional primary dose of

              severe Covid-19 related illness, using only presenting symptoms,
              comorbidities and demographic data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
              performed a case-control study with cases being those with severe
              disease, defined as ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death
              or discharge to hospice, and controls being those with non-severe
              disease. Predictor variables included patient demographics,
              symptoms and past medical history. Participants were 556 patients
              with laboratory confirmed Covid-19 and were included
              consecutively after presenting to the emergency department at a
              tertiary care center from March 1, 2020 to April 21, 2020
              RESULTS: Most common symptoms included cough (82\%), dyspnea
              (75\%), and fever/chills (77\%), with 96\% reporting at least one
              of these. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that
              increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI], 1.03-1.06), dyspnea (OR, 2.56; 95\% CI:
              1.51-4.33), male sex (OR, 1.70; 95\% CI: 1.10-2.64),
              immunocompromised status (OR, 2.22; 95\% CI: 1.17-4.16) and CKD
              (OR, 1.76; 95\% CI: 1.01-3.06) were significant predictors of
              severe Covid-19 infection. Hyperlipidemia was found to be
              negatively associated with severe disease (OR, 0.54; 95\% CI:
              0.33-0.90). A predictive equation based on these variables
              demonstrated fair ability to discriminate severe vs non-severe
              outcomes using only this historical information (AUC: 0.76).
              CONCLUSIONS: Severe Covid-19 illness can be predicted using data
              that could be obtained from a remote screening. With validation,

               prognostic impact amongst KTR with severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has not been
               specifically investigated. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study
               of 49 KTR who presented with COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory
               risk factors for severe disease and mortality were prospectively
               collected and analyzed with respect to outcomes. The study
               participants were divided into 3 groups: (1) mild disease
               manageable in an outpatient setting (n = 8), (2) nonsevere
               disease requiring hospitalization (n = 21), and (3) severe
               disease (n = 20). RESULTS: Gastrointestinal manifestations were
               common at diagnosis. The 30-day mortality rate in hospitalized
               patients was 19.5\%. Early elevations of C-reactive protein
               (>100 mg/L) and interleukin-6 (>65 ng/L) followed by increases
               in high-sensitivity troponin I (>30 ng/L) and D-dimer (>960
               ng/mL) were significantly associated with severe disease and
               mortality. Viral load did not have prognostic significance in
               our sample, suggesting that outcomes were chiefly driven by a
               cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CONCLUSIONS: Regular monitoring

               disruption that comes as a result of IMID treatments has been
               important during the COVID-19 pandemic. With vaccines becoming

               with the human mmunodeficiency virus (HIV) were identified as a
               new disease entity and the cause of acquired immunodeficiency
               disease (AIDS). This virus, unlike any other, is capable of
               causing severe suppression of our adaptive immune defense
               mechanisms by directly infecting and destroying helper T cells
               leading to increased susceptibility to a wide variety of
               microbial pathogens, especially those considered to be
               intracellular or opportunistic. After T cells are infected, HIV
               reproduces itself via a somewhat unique mechanism involving
               various metabolic steps, which includes the use of a reverse
               transcriptase enzyme that enables the viral RNA to produce
               copies of its complementary DNA. Subsequent physiologic steps
               lead to the production of new virus progeny and the eventual
               death of the invaded T cell. Fortunately, both serologic and
               molecular tests (such as PCR) can be used to confirm the
               diagnosis of an HIV infection. In the wake of the current
               COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that people living with HIV/AIDS
               are equally or slightly more susceptible to the etiologic agent,
               SARS-CoV-2, than the general population having intact immune
               systems, but they may have more serious outcomes. Limited
               clinical trials have also shown that the currently available
               COVID-19 vaccines are both safe and effective in affording
               protection to HIV/AIDS patients. In this review, we further

               during this outbreak. DESIGN: Face-to-face semistructured
               interviews were conducted. SETTING: A tertiary cancer care
               facility. PARTICIPANTS: 16 patients with cancer and 14
               caregivers. Inclusions criteria were: (A) diagnosed with cancer,
               (B) receiving active treatment or follow-ups, (C) aged 21 years
               and above and (D) fluent in English or Mandarin. RESULTS:
               Thematic analysis was conducted. Five themes were identified:
               heightened sense of threat, impact on healthcare experience,
               responsibility falls on oneself, striving for normalcy and sense
               of safety and trust. Heightened threat of COVID-19 was more
               pronounced in patients and linked to vulnerability and fear,
               uncertainty and actions of socially irresponsible others.
               Dominant in their healthcare experience was prioritising cancer
               and treatment amidst heightened threat and anticipatory worry
               about treatment disruptions. Both noted on the importance of
               taking responsibility for one's health, with caregivers
               reporting a reinforced sense of duty towards patients. They
               strived to maintain normalcy by viewing COVID-19 as beyond
               personal control, downplaying and living life as usual. Their
               resolve was supported by a sense of safety from the actions of
               authorities, hospitals and trust towards healthcare providers.
               CONCLUSIONS: Cancer intensifies threat and the emotional impact
               of COVID-19 and may trigger specific concerns related to
               treatment. Psychoeducation interventions led by healthcare
               providers over digital platforms could help address

              vaccination is considered one of the most promising and
              socioeconomically sustainable strategy to help control the
              pandemic and several vaccines are currently being distributed in
              nationwide mass immunization campaigns. Very limited data are
              available on benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccination in
              immunocompromised patients and in particular in solid organ or
              hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients as they were
              excluded from phase III trials. This review summarizes current
              knowledge, international guidelines and controversies regarding
              COVID-19 vaccination in these vulnerable populations. RECENT
              FINDINGS: Various COVID-19 vaccine platforms showed good efficacy
              in phase III trials in the immunocompetent and there are data
              arising on the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in the
              immunocompromised population. SUMMARY: Transplant recipients
              could benefit significantly from COVID-19 vaccination, both
              through active immunization provided they elicit protective
              vaccine responses, and probably through cocooning by immunization
              of caregivers and healthcare personnel and thus reducing the risk
              of SARS-coronavirus-2 exposure. Although awaiting more data on
              the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to inform potential
              adaptations of vaccine regimens, we strongly recommend
              prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination of solid and hematopoietic stem
              cell transplant recipients to decrease COVID-19-related morbidity

               period of 12 months prior to 1 March 2020 (estimated time of
               outbreak in Denmark). We estimated the adjusted risk of
               hospitalization for COVID-19 for patients treated with the
               above-mentioned categories of medications, compared to the rest
               of the population. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratios of
               hospitalization in patients treated with corticosteroids and
               cyclosporine/tacrolimus were 1.64 (95\% confidence interval [CI]
               1.35 to 2.00) and 4.75 (95\% CI 1.96 to 11.49), respectively.
               The risks of hospitalization in patients treated with
               thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-TNF-$\alpha$ agents, were
               1.93 (95\% CI 0.91 to 4.08), 0.74 (95\% CI 0.43 to 1.28), 1.00
               (95\% CI 0.52 to 1.94), respectively. The number of outcomes in
               patients treated with anti-interleukin therapeutic agents and
               selective immunosuppressive agents was too small for analysis.
               CONCLUSION: Patients treated with systemic corticosteroids and
               cyclosporine/tacrolimus had a significantly increased risk of
               being hospitalized for COVID-19. Our study does not uncover
               whether the increased risk is related to the drug itself, the
               underlying condition for which the patient is treated or other
               factors.",

               (COVID-19) in onco-hematological patients are unknown. When
               compared to non-immunocompromised patients, onco-hematological
               patients seem to have higher mortality rates. AIMS: We describe
               the characteristics and outcomes of a consecutive cohort of 24
               onco-hematological patients with COVID-19 during the first month
               of the pandemic. We also describe variations in healthcare
               resource utilization within our hematology department. METHODS
               AND RESULTS: Data from patients between the first month of the
               pandemic were retrospectively collected. Clinical and logistic
               data were also collected and compared with the average values
               from the prior 3 months of activity. Prevalence of COVID-19 in
               our hematological population was 0.4\%. Baseline characteristics
               were as follows: male sex: 83\%, lymphoid diseases: 46\%, median
               age: 69 (22-82) years. Median follow-up in survivors was 14
               (9-28) days and inpatient mortality rate was 46\%. Average time
               to moderate/severe respiratory insufficiency and death were 3
               (1-10) and 10 (3-18) days, respectively. Only 1 out of every 12
               patients who developed moderate to severe respiratory
               insufficiency recovered. Upon univariate analysis, the following
               factors were associated with higher mortality: age $\geq$ 70
               years (P = .01) and D-dimer $\geq$900 mcg/L (P = .04). With
               respect to indirect effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
               when compared with the prior 3 months of activity, inpatient
               mortality (excluding patients with COVID-19 included in the
               study) increased by 56\%. This was associated with a more
               frequent use of vasoactive drugs (+300\%) and advanced
               respiratory support (+133\%) in the hematology ward. In the
               outpatient setting, there was a reduction in initial visits
               (-55\%) and chemotherapy sessions (-19\%). A significant
               increase in phone visits was reported (+581\%). CONCLUSION:
               COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated mortality in
               hematological patients. Negative indirect effects are also
               evident within this setting.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the
               management of systemic immunosuppressive treatments for
               rheumatic conditions. It is well known that rheumatic patients
               are at risk of developing infections because of their
               immunocompromised state. Moreover, drugs such as
               hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab that are widely used to treat
               rheumatic diseases are now being used to treat COVID-19. The aim
               of this multicentre retrospective study of rheumatic patients in
               the Italian regions of Lombardy and Marche was to determine
               whether patients receiving biological or small molecules
               treatment are more susceptible to the development of COVID-19
               than the general population. METHODS: The local registry data of
               10,260 rheumatic patients being treated with bDMARDs or small
               molecules were evaluated from 15 March to 23 April 2020. The
               final analysis was based on the registry data relating to 7.204,
               telephone contacts and/or outpatient visits. RESULTS:
               Forty-seven of the 7.204 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19,
               seven of whom died; the patients who had symptoms resembling
               those of COVID-19 but had negative swabs were considered
               negative for the disease. The overall infection rate was 0.65,
               and the crude case fatality risk (CFR) in the patients with
               COVID-19 was 14.9\%. There was no difference in the mortality
               rate among the patients receiving the different individual
               biological drugs or small molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
               suggest that the susceptibility of rheumatic patients to
               COVID-19 is the same as that of the general population, but
               confirm that age, disease duration, and the number of
               co-morbidities are associated with an increased risk of a severe
               form of the disease. It seems that immunosuppressants drugs do
               not effectively represent a risk factor for COVID- 19.",

               hospital-acquired (nosocomial) COVID-19 infection globally. We
               investigated the risk of mortality and critical care admission
               in hospitalised adults with nosocomial COVID-19, relative to
               adults requiring hospitalisation due to community-acquired
               infection. Methods: We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed
               and pre-print literature from 1/1/2020 to 9/2/2021 without
               language restriction for studies reporting outcomes of
               nosocomial and community-acquired COVID-19. We performed a
               random effects meta-analysis (MA) to estimate the 1) relative
               risk of death and 2) critical care admission, stratifying
               studies by patient cohort characteristics and nosocomial case
               definition. Results: 21 studies were included in the primary MA,
               describing 8,251 admissions across 8 countries during the first
               wave, comprising 1513 probable or definite nosocomial COVID-19,
               and 6738 community-acquired cases. Across all studies, the risk
               of mortality was 1.3 times greater in patients with nosocomial
               infection, compared to community-acquired (95\% CI: 1.005 to
               1.683). Rates of critical care admission were similar between
               groups (Relative Risk, RR=0.74, 95\% CI: 0.50 to 1.08).
               Immunosuppressed patients diagnosed with nosocomial COVID-19
               were twice as likely to die in hospital as those admitted with
               community-acquired infection (RR=2.14, 95\% CI: 1.76 to 2.61).
               Conclusions: Adults who acquire SARS-CoV-2 whilst already
               hospitalised are at greater risk of mortality compared to
               patients admitted following community-acquired infection; this
               finding is largely driven by a substantially increased risk of
               death in individuals with malignancy or who had undergone
               transplantation. These findings inform public health and
               infection control policy and argue for individualised clinical
               interventions to combat the threat of nosocomial COVID-19,

               manifestations and outcome as well as antibody responses to
               SARS-CoV-2 were recorded among 77 consecutive patients with
               underlying AARD infected by SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of data was
               performed using univariate and multivariate models. Most
               patients (68.8\%) had a mild COVID-19 course. The predominant
               clinical manifestations were fatigue (58.4\%), low grade fever

               quarter of patients required hospitalization (23.3\%) and the
               mortality rate was 1.3\%. Regarding COVID-19 severity, prior
               treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil or

               serious disease course (60.0 vs 29.9\%, p = 0.003, 40.0 vs

               of the AARD were found to be independent predictive factors for

               [1.11-37.19]). Among COVID-19 related features, patients with
               shortness of breath and high-grade fever were more likely to get
               hospitalized (OR [95\%]: 7.06 [1.36-36.57], 12.04 [2.96-48.86]),
               while anosmia was independently associated with lower
               hospitalization risk (OR [95\%]: 0.09 [0.01-0.99]). Though the
               majority of AARD patients displayed a mild COVID-19 course,

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the global
               community with nearly 4.9 million deaths as of October 2021.
               While organ transplant (OT) recipients (OTr) may be at increased
               risk for severe COVID-19 due to their chronic immunocompromised
               state, outcomes for OTr with COVID-19 remain disputed in the
               literature. This review will examine whether OTr with COVID-19
               are at higher risk for severe illness and death than
               non-immunocompromised individuals. METHODS: MEDLINE (via Ovid
               and PubMed) and EMBASE (via Embase.com ) will be searched from
               December 2019 to October 2021 for observational studies
               (including cohort and case-control) that compare COVID-19
               clinical outcomes in OTr to those in individuals without history
               of OT. The primary outcome of interest will be mortality as
               defined in each study, with possible further analyses of
               in-hospital mortality, 28 or 30-day mortality, and all-cause
               mortality versus mortality attributable to COVID-19. The
               secondary outcome of interest will be the severity of COVID-19
               disease, most frequently defined as requiring intensive care
               unit admission or mechanical ventilation. Two reviewers will
               independently screen all abstracts and full-text articles.
               Potential conflicts will be resolved by a third reviewer and
               potentially discussion among all investigators. Methodological
               quality will be appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. If
               data permit, we will perform random-effects meta-analysis with
               the Sidik-Jonkman estimator and the Hartung-Knapp adjustment for
               confidence intervals to estimate a summary measure of
               association between histories of transplant with each outcome.
               Potential sources of heterogeneity will be explored using
               meta-regression. Additional analyses will be conducted to
               explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g., subgroup
               analysis) considering least minimal adjustment for confounders.
               DISCUSSION: This rapid review will assess the available evidence
               on whether OTr diagnosed with COVID-19 are at higher risk for
               severe illness and death compared to non-immunocompromised
               individuals. Such knowledge is clinically relevant and may
               impact risk stratification, allocation of organs and healthcare
               resources, and organ transplantation protocols during this, and

               the clinical course and the challenging management of early
               COVID-19 infection in two heart transplant recipients who tested
               positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the perioperative period of

               treatments at baseline are at increased risk of opportunistic
               infections. These patients are at especially increased risk of
               morbidity and mortality during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)
               pandemic. This review will focus on patients with diseases in
               which immunosuppression is a vital part of the treatment
               regimen, including those with solid organ transplants,
               rheumatologic disorders, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory bowel
               disease (IBD). We will summarize the current knowledge of
               immunosuppression in these diseases and the risk of contracting
               COVID-19. Furthermore, we will discuss if immunosuppression
               increases severity of COVID-19 presentation. RECENT FINDINGS:
               Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number
               patients receiving chronic immunosuppression have been infected
               with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our understanding of the immunology
               of SARS-CoV-2 is advancing at a rapid pace. Currently, a number
               of clinical trials are underway to investigate the role of
               immunosuppressive treatments in the management of this disease.
               SUMMARY: Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest
               that solid organ transplant recipients on chronic
               immunosuppression are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19.
               Solid organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk for
               worse COVID-19 outcomes but the data are not consistent. There
               is evidence to suggest that patients with rheumatologic
               disorders or IBDs are not at increased risk of contracting
               COVID-19 and do not necessarily experience worse clinical
               outcomes. Patients with sarcoidosis are not necessarily at
               increased risk of COVID-19, although there is limited data
               available to determine if immunosuppression worsens outcomes in
               this population.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted mainly
               through the respiratory tract, possible transmission by
               transfusion from asymptomatic carriers should be explored. As
               yet there are no reports of transfusion transmission of
               COVID-19. Haemovigilance findings within a three-month
               surveillance period during the new coronavirus pandemic are
               presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to great demand and
               shortage, blood sessions in outpatient facilities were organized
               during the high prevalence period of COVID-19, alongside a
               national plan to monitor the evolving public health situation by
               random molecular screening of high-risk groups of the
               population. Haemovigilance protocols were implemented as well as
               surveillance for any COVID-19 case reported post-transfusion. A
               14-day quarantine and follow-up molecular and antibody testing
               of any COVID-19 positive case was obligatory. RESULTS:
               Post-donation, post-transfusion information and molecular
               testing of swab samples collected from three asymptomatic donors
               at risk for COVID-19, revealed the case of an immunosupressed
               patient who had been transfused with whole blood derived
               platelets from a donor subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. The
               recipient exhibited no symptoms of the disease. Molecular and
               antibody testing results were negative. CONCLUSION:
               Haemovigilance provided information supporting the absence of
               transfusion transmission of COVID-19, thus strengthening the
               hypothesis that, even if it cannot yet be definitively ruled
               out, COVID-19 is not transmitted through blood transfusion. As
               of early June 2020, a perfect test does not exist, therefore
               haemovigilance along with the implementation of strict proactive
               measures is crucial to identify eluding asymptomatic individuals
               and ensure blood safety during the pandemic.",

              quality in adolescents with and without chronic immunosuppressive
              conditions quarantined during the coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included
              305 adolescents with chronic immunocompromised conditions and 82
              healthy adolescents. Online surveys were completed, which
              included questions on socio-demographic data and self-rated
              healthcare routine during COVID-19 quarantine and the following
              validated questionnaires: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
              (PSQI), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL4.0), and
              Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument (PODCI). RESULTS:
              The median current age [14 (10-18) vs. 15 (10-18) years, p=0.847]
              and frequency of female sex (62\% vs. 58\%, p=0.571) were similar
              in adolescents with chronic conditions compared with healthy
              adolescents. The frequency of poor sleep quality was similar in
              both groups (38\% vs. 48\%, p=0.118). Logistic regression
              analysis, including both healthy adolescents and adolescents with
              chronic conditions (n=387), demonstrated that self-reported
              increase in screen time (odds ratio [OR] 3.0; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI] 1.3-6.8; p=0.008) and intrafamilial violence report
              (OR 2.1; 95\% CI 1.2-3.5; p=0.008) were independently associated
              with poor sleep quality in these adolescents. However, the PODCI
              global function score was associated with a lower OR for poor
              sleep quality (OR 0.97; 95\% CI 0.94-0.99; p=0.001). Further
              logistic regression, including only adolescents with chronic
              conditions (n=305), demonstrated that self-reported increase in
              screen time (OR 3.1; 95\% CI 1.4-6.8; p=0.006) and intrafamilial
              violence report (OR 2.0; 95\% CI 1.2-3.4; p=0.011) remained
              independently associated with poor quality of sleep, whereas a
              lower PODCI global function score was associated with a lower OR
              for sleep quality (OR 0.96; 95\% CI 0.94-0.98; p<0.001).
              CONCLUSION: Self-reported increases in screen time and
              intrafamilial violence report impacted sleep quality in both
              healthy adolescents and those with chronic conditions. Decreased
              health-related quality of life was observed in adolescents with
              poor sleep quality.",

               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide
               is a major public health concern. Cancer patients are considered
               a vulnerable population to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may develop
               several COVID-19 symptoms. The heightened immunocompromised
               state, prolonged chronic pro-inflammatory milieu coupled with
               comorbid conditions are shared in both disease conditions and
               may influence patient outcome. Although ovarian cancer (OC) and
               COVID-19 are diseases of entirely different primary organs, both
               diseases share similar molecular and cellular characteristics in
               their microenvironment suggesting a potential cooperativity
               leading to poor outcome. In COVID-19 related cases,
               hospitalizations and deaths worldwide are lower in women than in
               males; however, comorbidities associated with OC may increase
               the COVID-19 risk in women. The women at the age of 50-60 years
               are at greater risk of developing OC as well as SARS-CoV-2
               infection. Increased levels of gonadotropin and androgen,
               dysregulated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS),
               hyper-coagulation and chronic inflammation are common conditions
               observed among OC and severe cases of COVID-19. The upregulation
               of common inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as tumor
               necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), interleukin
               (IL)-1$\beta$, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-$\gamma$-inducible
               protein 10 (IP-10), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
               (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage
               colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), among others in the sera of
               COVID-19 and OC subjects suggests potentially similar
               mechanism(s) involved in the hyper-inflammatory condition
               observed in both disease states. Thus, it is conceivable that
               the pathogenesis of OC may significantly contribute to the
               potential infection by SARS-CoV-2. Our understanding of the
               influence and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection on OC is at an
               early stage and in this article, we review the underlying
               pathogenesis presented by various comorbidities of OC and

              Vaccination significantly protects against severe COVID-19,
              hospitalization and death; it also protects against symptomatic
              infection and reduces the risk of transmission to other people.
              Protection against the new SARS-CoV-2 variants may be lower, but
              protection against severe course and death remains high. Two mRNA
              vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) and two vector vaccines
              (AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S) are currently available in the Czech
              Republic. Vaccination of persons over 60 years of age and
              immunocompromised persons, who are demonstrably at the highest
              risk of a serious course of the disease, is of the utmost
              importance. In order to achieve adequate vaccination coverage, it
              is necessary to motivate other groups of people to be vaccinated,
              including children over 12 years of age and young adults.
              Vaccination is also recommended in pregnant women in the 2nd and
              3rd trimesters and in breastfeeding women. For selected groups of
              vaccines, a third dose of vaccination is recommended (additional

              12 months after the second dose). The side effects are usually

  abstract  = "Coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1 are endemic human
               respiratory coronaviruses that typically cause mild to moderate
               upper respiratory infections, similar to the common cold. They
               also may cause simple and complicated lower respiratory
               infections, otitis media, asthma exacerbations, gastroenteritis,
               and a few systemic complications. These viruses are usually
               seasonal (with winter dominance) and affect nearly all age
               groups. The seasonal and annual variation in virus prevalence
               has implications for understanding the concept of acquired
               immunity and its persistence or diminution. Coronaviruses
               generally have outbreak potential in susceptible populations of
               any age, particularly in patients with comorbidities, who tend
               to have increased clinical disease. These 4 coronaviruses are
               often found in the context of what appears to be coinfection
               with other pathogens, but especially other viruses. If
               coronaviruses are not specifically tested for, the sole
               detection of a viral copathogen would suggest the pathogen is
               the causative agent, when a coronavirus may be culpable, or
               both. The detection of these viruses in circumstances where
               respiratory viruses are generally sought in clinical samples is,
               therefore, justified. These pathogens can be chronically shed
               from the respiratory tract, which is more likely to occur among
               immunocompromised and complicated patients. These viruses share
               the potential for genetic drift. The genome is among the largest
               of RNA viruses, and the capability of these viruses to further
               change is likely underestimated. Given the potential disease
               among humans, it is justified to search for effective antiviral
               chemotherapy for these viruses and to consider uses in niche
               situations should effective therapy be defined. Whereas
               SARS-CoV-2 may follow the epidemiological pattern of SARS-CoV
               and extinguish slowly over time, there is yet concern that
               SARS-CoV-2 may establish itself as an endemic human respiratory
               coronavirus similar to OC43, 2299E, NL63, and HKU1. Until
               sufficient data are acquired to better understand the potential
               of SARS-CoV-2, continued work on antiviral therapy and

               Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pediatric cancer patients
               is still lacking. The aim of this prospective study was to
               describe clinical management and outcomes of COVID-19 in
               pediatric oncology patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Conducted
               between May 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020, this study included
               76 pediatric oncology patients with confirmed COVID-19.
               Remdesivir (RDV) was the antiviral therapy used. RESULTS: The
               median age of patients was 9 years. Sixty patients were on first
               line treatment. Hematological malignancies constituted 86.8\% of
               patients. Severe to critical infections were 35.4\% of patients.
               The commonest symptom was fever (93.4\%). Chemotherapy was
               delayed in 59.2\% of patients and doses were modified in 30.2\%.
               The 60-day overall survival (OS) stood at 86.8\%, with
               mortalities occurring only among critical patients. Of sixteen
               acute leukemia patients in the first induction therapy, 13
               survived and 10 achieved complete remission. A negative RT-PCR
               within 2 weeks and improvement of radiological findings were
               statistically related to disease severity (P = .008 and .002,
               respectively). Better OS was associated with regression of
               radiological findings after 30 days from infection (P = .002).
               Forty-five patients received RDV, 42.1\% had severe and critical
               forms of infection compared to 25.7\% in the No-RDV group and
               yet OS was comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: Most pediatric
               cancer patients with COVID-19 should have good clinical outcomes
               except for patients with critical infections. Cancer patients
               can tolerate chemotherapy including induction phase, alongside
               COVID-19 treatment. In severe and critical COVID-19, RDV might
               have a potential benefit.",

               the twenty-first century, with over one-hundred million
               infections and over two million deaths to date. It is a novel
               strain from the Coronaviridae family, named Severe Acute
               Respiratory Distress Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2); the
               7th known member of the coronavirus family to cause disease in
               humans, notably following the Middle East Respiratory syndrome
               (MERS), and Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (SARS).
               The most characteristic feature of this single-stranded RNA
               molecule includes the spike glycoprotein on its surface. Most
               patients with COVID-19, of which the elderly and
               immunocompromised are most at risk, complain of flu-like
               symptoms, including dry cough and headache. The most common
               complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress
               syndrome, septic shock, and cardiovascular manifestations.
               Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mainly via respiratory droplets,
               either directly from the air when an infected patient coughs or
               sneezes, or in the form of fomites on surfaces. Maintaining
               hand-hygiene, social distancing, and personal protective
               equipment (i.e., masks) remain the most effective precautions.
               Patient management includes supportive care and anticoagulative
               measures, with a focus on maintaining respiratory function.
               Therapy with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab appear
               to be most promising to date, with hydroxychloroquine,
               lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferons falling out of favour.
               Additionally, accelerated vaccination efforts have taken place
               internationally, with several promising vaccinations being mass
               deployed. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries and
               stakeholders have taken varying precautions to combat and
               contain the spread of the virus and dampen its collateral
               economic damage. This review paper aims to synthesize the impact

               However, there was still no unanimous opinion on the use of
               these therapy during COVID-19 epidemic. Current studies
               suggested that systemic corticosteroids might increase the risk

               pronounced after mRNA priming (p = .0001 each), whereas CD4 and

               functions, e.g., so-called low-density neutrophils, containing
               granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (LDNs/PMN-MDSCs).
               These cells have been described in both infections and cancer
               and are known for their immunosuppressive activity. In the case
               of COVID-19, long-term complications have been frequently
               observed (long-COVID). In this context, we aimed to investigate
               the immune response of COVID-19 convalescents after a mild or
               asymptomatic course of disease. We enrolled 13 convalescents who
               underwent a mild or asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2,
               confirmed by a positive result of the PCR test, and 13 healthy
               donors without SARS-CoV-2 infection in the past. Whole blood was
               used for T-cell subpopulation and LDNs/PMN-MDSCs analysis.
               LDNs/PMN-MDSCs and normal density neutrophils (NDNs) were sorted
               out by FACS and used for T-cell proliferation assay with
               autologous T cells activated with anti-CD3 mAb. Serum samples
               were used for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing IgG
               and GM-CSF concentration. Our results showed that in
               convalescents, even 3 months after infection, an elevated level
               of LDNs/PMN-MDSCs is still maintained in the blood, which
               correlates negatively with the level of CD8+ and double-negative
               T cells. Moreover, LDNs/PMN-MDSCs and NDNs showed a tendency for
               affecting the production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 neutralizing
               antibodies. Surprisingly, our data showed that in addition to
               LDNs/PMN-MDSCs, NDNs from convalescents also inhibit
               proliferation of autologous T cells. Additionally, in the
               convalescent sera, we detected significantly higher
               concentrations of GM-CSF, indicating the role of emergency
               granulopoiesis. We conclude that in mild or asymptomatic
               COVID-19 convalescents, the neutrophil dysfunction, including

               severe patients. Nevertheless, other tissues and organs are also
               known to be critically affected following infection, thereby
               complicating the overall aetiology and prognosis. Excluding
               H1N1, the SARS-CoV (also referred as SARS-CoV-1), MERS, and
               SARS-CoV-2 are collectively referred to as coronaviruses, and
               taxonomically placed under the realm Riboviria, order
               Nidovirales, suborder Cornidovirineae, family Coronaviridae,
               subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus, and
               subgenus Sarbecovirus. As of 23 September 2021, the ongoing
               SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has globally resulted in around 229 million
               and 4.7 million reported infections and deaths, respectively,
               apart from causing huge psychosomatic debilitation, academic
               loss, and deep economic recession. Such an unprecedented
               pandemic has compelled researchers, especially epidemiologists
               and immunologists, to search for SARS-CoV-2-associated potential
               immunogenic molecules to develop a vaccine as an immediate
               prophylactic measure. Amongst multiple structural and
               non-structural proteins, the homotrimeric spike (S) glycoprotein
               has been empirically found as the most suitable candidate for
               vaccine development owing to its immense immunogenic potential,
               which makes it capable of eliciting both humoral and
               cell-mediated immune responses. As a consequence, it has become
               possible to design appropriate, safe, and effective vaccines,
               apart from related therapeutic agents, to reduce both morbidity
               and mortality. As of 23 September 2021, four vaccines, namely,
               Comirnaty, COVID-19 vaccine Janssen, Spikevax, and Vaxzevria,
               have received the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) approval,
               and around thirty are under the phase three clinical trial with
               emergency authorization by the vaccine-developing
               country-specific National Regulatory Authority (NRA). In
               addition, 100-150 vaccines are under various phases of
               pre-clinical and clinical trials. The mainstay of global
               vaccination is to introduce herd immunity, which would protect
               the majority of the population, including immunocompromised
               individuals, from infection and disease. Here, we primarily
               discuss category-wise vaccine development, their respective
               advantages and disadvantages, associated efficiency and
               potential safety aspects, antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 structural
               proteins and immune responses to them along with the emergence
               of SARS-CoV-2 VOC, and the urgent need of achieving herd
               immunity to contain the pandemic.",

               with COVID-19 seen from 3 March to 29 October 2020. We described
               the distribution of underlying comorbidities, quality of care

               indicators across race groups. We also described clinical
               outcomes in hospitalised patients including length of stay,
               intensive care unit (ICU) admission, readmission and mortality.
               We performed multivariable analyses for hospitalisation risk
               among all patients with COVID-19 and stratifyied by race and
               sex. SETTING: KPGA, an integrated healthcare system.
               PARTICIPANTS: 5712 patients who all had laboratory-confirmed
               COVID-19. Of them, 57.8\% were female, 58.4\% black, 29.5\%
               white, 8.5\% Hispanic and 3.6\% Asian. RESULTS: Black patients
               had the highest proportions of living in neighborhoods under the
               federal poverty line (12.4\%) and in more deprived locations
               (neighbourhood deprivation index=0.4). Overall, 14.4\% (n=827)
               of this cohort was hospitalised. Asian patients had the highest
               rates of ICU admission (53.1\%) and mechanical ventilation
               (21.9\%). Among all patients, Hispanics (adjusted 1.60, 95\% CI
               (1.08, 2.37)), blacks (1.43 (1.13, 1.83)), age in years (1.03

               (1.08 (1.03, 1.13)) were associated with higher odds of
               hospitalisation. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive
               pulmonary disease (2.59 (1.67, 4.02)), chronic heart failure
               (1.79 (1.31, 2.45)), immunocompromised (1.77 (1.16, 2.70)), with
               glycated haemoglobin >8\% (1.68 (1.19, 2.38)), depression (1.60

               inactivity (1.25 (1.03, 1.51)) had higher odds of
               hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: Black and Hispanic KPGA patients
               were at higher odds of hospitalisation, but not mortality,
               compared with other race groups. Beyond previously reported

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Cancer is a life-threatening disease often with
              curative therapy approaches, high risk of relapse and distressing
              symptoms, which require immediate, quality-assured care
              throughout the entire therapy process including rehabilitation,
              even in a pandemie. METHODS: We started to develop a pandemic
              plan to maintain oncological rehabilitation in February 2020.
              With the involvement of the whole clinic staff we developed
              protection scenarios with the aim of achieving Covid-19-free
              clinics. Schedules were developed and implemented based on the
              epidemiological bulletins of the RKI (Robert Koch Institute,
              Germany) of 2017 (influenza infection) and 2020 (Covid-19). The
              effects of these measures were evaluated by means of a patient
              and employee survey. RESULTS: The challenges of the pandemic have
              been successfully implemented. Both the patient and employee
              surveys showed a high level of acceptance of the measures. For
              example, 98.5\% of patients stated that the continuation of
              rehabilitation was important for their health, even in the
              pandemic situation. At the same time, 87\% felt safe. 88\% of all
              employees (MA) and 93\% of MA in the risk group stated that the
              protective measures were introduced at the right time. At the
              same time, 76\% of all employees and 84\% of the employees in the
              risk group agreed with the additional burden. In spite of the
              high risk potential in the clinics (immunocompromised patients,
              patients from different districts with different levels of
              exposure), an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 could be avoided in the
              clinics. CONCLUSION: The timely roll-out of adapted pandemic
              rules in rehabilitation clinics enables the continuation of
              high-quality oncological rehabilitation even in pandemic times
              and thus contributes to a stabilisation of the supply chain for
              cancer diseases. A high level of acceptance of the measures among
              patients and hospital staff was evaluated.",

               fungal infection, mucormycosis has emerged with more fatal
               responses and significantly increased mortality rate. To measure
               the severity and potential alternative approaches against black
               fungus coinfection in COVID-19 patients, PubMed, Google Scholar,
               World Health Organization (WHO) newsletters, and other online
               resources, based on the cases reported and retrospective
               observational analysis were searched from the years 2015-2021.
               The studies reporting mucormycosis with Severe Acute Respiratory
               Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coinfection and/or
               demonstrating potential risk factors, such as a history of
               diabetes mellitus or suppressed immune system were included, and

               than 20 case reports and observational studies on black fungus
               coinfection in COVID-19 patients were eligible for inclusion.
               The results indicated that diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemic, and
               immunocompromised COVID-19 patients with mucormycosis were at a
               higher risk. We found that it was prudent to assess the

               standardized diagnostic and clinical settings. Large-scale
               studies need to be conducted to identify early biomarkers and
               optimization of diagnostic methods has to be established per
               population and geographical variation. This will not only help
               clinicians around the world to detect the coinfection in time

               data extraction of the first 401 patients at the University of

               literature review of immunocompromised lymphoma patients
               experiencing prolonged COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: Although
               requiring a full 1 year, the presented case eventually achieved
               spontaneous resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia. Anti-SARS-CoV-2
               antibodies could not be detected throughout the disease course,
               but COVID-19-directed T-cell response was found to be intact.
               The patient also developed secondary immune thrombocytopenia
               subsequent to COVID-19 pneumonia. We found 19 case reports of
               immunocompromised lymphoma patients with prolonged COVID-19
               infections in the literature. All 5 patients who died did not
               receive convalescent plasma therapy, whereas resolution of
               COVID-19 infection was achieved in 8 out of 9 patients who
               received convalescent plasma therapy. CONCLUSIONS: We
               demonstrate through the presented case that while
               time-consuming, resolution of COVID-19 infections may be
               achieved without aid from humoral immunity if cellular immunity
               is intact. Immunocompromised lymphoma patients are at risk of a
               prolonged disease course of COVID-19, and convalescent plasma
               therapy may be a promising approach in such patients.",

               Immunocompromised patients represent a vulnerable population at
               high risk of developing severe COVID-19 and thus should be
               prioritized in the vaccination programs and in the study of the
               vaccine efficacy. Nevertheless, most data on efficacy and safety
               of the available vaccines derive from trials conducted on
               healthy individuals; hence, studies on immunogenicity of
               SARS-CoV2 vaccines in such populations are deeply needed. Here,
               we perform an observational longitudinal study analyzing the
               humoral and cellular response following the BNT162b2 mRNA
               COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of patients affected by inborn
               errors of immunity (IEI) compared to healthy controls (HC). We

               expansion of the Ag-specific CD4+CD40L+ T cells in both HC and
               IEI. Five IEI patients did not develop any specific CD4+CD40L+ T
               cellular response, with one of these patients unable to also
               mount any humoral response. These data raise immunologic
               concerns about using Ab response as a sole metric of protective
               immunity following vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Taken together,
               these findings suggest that evaluation of vaccine-induced

              currently faces the unprecedented challenges brought by the
              COVID-19 pandemic, further straining people and communities
              already facing structural and individual vulnerabilities. People
              with opioid use disorder (OUD) are facing unique challenges in
              response to COVID-19, such as not being able to adopt best
              practices (e.g., physical distancing) if they're financially
              insecure or living in shelters (or homeless). They also have
              other medical conditions that make them more likely to be
              immunocompromised and at risk of developing COVID-19. In response
              to the COVID-19 public health emergency, national and provincial
              regulatory bodies introduced guidance and exemptions to mitigate
              the spread of the virus. Among them, clinical guidance for
              prescribers were issued to allow take home opioid medications for
              opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Take Home for injectable opioid
              agonist treatment (iOAT) is only considered within a restrictive
              regulatory structure, specific to the pandemic. Nevertheless,
              this risk mitigation guidance allowed carries, mostly daily
              dispensed, to a population that would not have access to it prior
              to the pandemic. In this case it is presented and discussed that
              if a carry was possible during the pandemic, then the carry could
              continue post COVID-19 to address a gap in our approach to
              individualize care for people with OUD receiving iOAT. CASE
              PRESENTATION: Here we present the first case of a patient in
              Canada with long-term OUD that received take home injectable
              diacetylmorphine to self-isolate in an approved site after being
              diagnosed with COVID-19 during a visit to the emergency room
              where he was diagnosed with cellulitis and admitted to receive
              antibiotics. CONCLUSION: In the present case we demonstrated that
              it is feasible to provide iOAT outside the community clinic with
              no apparent negative consequences. Improving upon and making
              permanent these recently introduced risk mitigating guidance
              during COVID-19, have the potential not just to protect during
              the pandemic, but also to address long-overdue barriers to access
              evidence-based care in addiction treatment.",

               inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) are limited. METHODS: A
               multicentre observational study evaluated the immunogenicity and
               safety of the two-dose regimen BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in adult
               patients with AIIRD (n=686) compared with the general population
               (n=121). Serum IgG antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike
               S1/S2 proteins were measured 2-6 weeks after the second vaccine
               dose. Seropositivity was defined as IgG $\geq$15 binding
               antibody units (BAU)/mL. Vaccination efficacy, safety, and
               disease activity were assessed within 6 weeks after the second
               vaccine dose. RESULTS: Following vaccination, the seropositivity
               rate and S1/S2 IgG levels were significantly lower among
               patients with AIIRD versus controls (86\% (n=590) vs 100\%,
               p<0.0001 and 132.9$\pm$91.7 vs 218.6$\pm$82.06 BAU/mL, p<0.0001,
               respectively). Risk factors for reduced immunogenicity included
               older age and treatment with glucocorticoids, rituximab,
               mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and abatacept. Rituximab was the
               main cause of a seronegative response (39\% seropositivity).
               There were no postvaccination symptomatic cases of COVID-19
               among patients with AIIRD and one mild case in the control
               group. Major adverse events in patients with AIIRD included
               death (n=2) several weeks after the second vaccine dose,
               non-disseminated herpes zoster (n=6), uveitis (n=2), and
               pericarditis (n=1). Postvaccination disease activity remained
               stable in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: mRNA BNTb262
               vaccine was immunogenic in the majority of patients with AIIRD,
               with an acceptable safety profile. Treatment with

               Although the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in
               immunocompromised patients is unknown, many societies have
               recommended vaccination of this highly vulnerable patient
               population. METHODS: In this prospective study, we determined
               antibody responses to spike protein, 4 weeks after the 2nd dose
               of mRNA vaccines or after the single dose of Johnson \& Johnson
               vaccine, in LT recipients and those with chronic liver disease
               (CLD) with and without cirrhosis. RESULTS: Of the 233 patients
               enrolled so far, 62 were LT recipients, 79 had cirrhosis (10
               decompensated) and 92 had CLD without cirrhosis. Antibody titers
               were defined as undetectable (250 U/ml). Of the 62 patients who
               had LT, antibody levels were undetectable in 11 patients and
               suboptimal (median titer 17.6, range 0.47-212 U/ml) in 27
               patients. Among 79 patients with cirrhosis, 3 had undetectable
               antibody levels and 15 had suboptimal (median titer 41.3, range
               0.49-221 U/L) antibody responses. Of the 92 patients without
               cirrhosis, 4 had undetectable antibody levels and 19 had
               suboptimal (median titer 95.5, range 4.9-234 U/L) antibody
               responses. Liver transplantation, use of 2 or more
               immunosuppression medications and vaccination with a single dose
               of the Johnson \& Johnson vaccine were associated with poor
               immune response on multivariable analysis. No patient had any
               serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Poor antibody responses
               after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were seen in 61\% of LT recipients
               and 24\% of those with CLD. LAY SUMMARY: The clinical efficacy
               of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients is unknown.
               We performed a prospective study to evaluate immune responses to
               COVID-19 vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson \& Johnson) in 62
               liver transplant recipients, 79 patients with cirrhosis and 92
               with chronic liver diseases without cirrhosis. We found that

               This review explored the potential of Malawi's traditional
               medicinal plants for the management of COVID-19. Methods: The
               authors searched on PubMed and Google scholar for medicinal
               plants that are used in Malawi and published in openly available
               peer reviewed journals. Plants linked with antiviral treatment,
               anti-COVID-19 activity or COVID-19 symptoms management were
               targeted. These included activity against pneumonia,
               inflammation, cough, difficulty in breathing, pain/aches, fever,
               diarrhoea, rheumatism, fatigue, asthma, immunocompromised and
               cardiovascular diseases. Results: 11 studies were found with 306
               plant species. 127 plant species had at least one COVID-19
               related pharmacological activity. Of these plant species, the
               number of herbal entities used for each indication was:
               pain/aches (87), fever (2), pneumonia (9), breathing/asthma
               problems (5), coughing (11), diarrhoea (1), immunosuppression
               (8), blood issues (10), fatigue (2), heart problems (11),
               inflammation (8), rheumatism (10) and viral diseases (12).
               Thirty (30) species were used for more than one disease and
               Azedarachta indica topped the list (6 of the 13 COVID-19 related
               diseases). The majority of the species had phytochemicals known
               to have antiviral activity or mechanisms of actions linked to
               COVID-19 and consequent diseases' treatment pathways.
               Conclusion: Medicinal plants are a promising source of compounds
               that can be used for drug development of COVID-19 related
               diseases. This review highlights potential targets for the World

               making the individual susceptible to other diseases/infection.

               33.9\%-67.2\%) and by county (range = 8.8\%-89.0\%).†
               Unvaccinated persons, as well as persons with certain
               immunocompromising conditions (3), remain at substantial risk
               for infection, severe illness, and death, especially in areas
               where the level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission is high.
               The Delta variant is more than two times as transmissible as the
               original strains circulating at the start of the pandemic and is
               causing large, rapid increases in infections, which could
               compromise the capacity of some local and regional health care
               systems to provide medical care for the communities they serve.
               Until vaccination coverage is high and community transmission is
               low, public health practitioners, as well as schools,
               businesses, and institutions (organizations) need to regularly
               assess the need for prevention strategies to avoid stressing
               health care capacity and imperiling adequate care for both
               COVID-19 and other non-COVID-19 conditions. CDC recommends five
               critical factors be considered to inform local decision-making:
               1) level of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission; 2) health system
               capacity; 3) COVID-19 vaccination coverage; 4) capacity for
               early detection of increases in COVID-19 cases; and 5)
               populations at increased risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.
               Among strategies to prevent COVID-19, CDC recommends all
               unvaccinated persons wear masks in public indoor settings. Based
               on emerging evidence on the Delta variant (2), CDC also
               recommends that fully vaccinated persons wear masks in public
               indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission.
               Fully vaccinated persons might consider wearing a mask in public
               indoor settings, regardless of transmission level, if they or
               someone in their household is immunocompromised or is at
               increased risk for severe disease, or if someone in their
               household is unvaccinated (including children aged <12 years who
               are currently ineligible for vaccination).",

               2019 (COVID-19) is still looming large with a paucity of
               treatment options. To add to this burden, a sizeable subset of
               patients who have recovered from acute COVID-19 infection have
               reported lingering symptoms, leading to significant disability
               and impairment of their daily life activities. These patients
               are considered to suffer from what has been termed as
               ``chronic'' or ``long'' COVID-19 or a form of post-acute
               sequelae of COVID-19, and patients experiencing this syndrome
               have been termed COVID-19 long-haulers. Despite recovery from

               including extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pains,
               brain fogs, anxiety and depression, that could last for months

               be largely responsible for the appearance of these lasting
               symptoms, possibly through facilitating an ongoing inflammatory
               process. In this review, we hypothesize potential immunological

               COVID-19 infection and did not receive any immunosuppressive
               therapies. CASE REPORT A 49-year-old man with a history of
               uncontrolled diabetes presented to the hospital with multiple
               generalized tonic clonic seizures. He had recently been
               diagnosed with mild COVID-19 and was treated at home with
               supportive care only. He was found to have cerebritis in the
               right frontal lobe along with right fronto-ethmoid sinusitis. He
               underwent extensive testing with nasal endoscopy with gram stain
               and culture, cryptococcal studies, 1-3-Beta-D glucan, blood
               cultures, fungal CSF studies, Lyme disease, HIV, Fungitell
               assay, and galactomannan studies, which were all negative. He
               was started on i.v. antibacterial therapy with cefepime,
               vancomycin, and metronidazole along with amphotericin B. After 2
               weeks, his repeat imaging revealed progression of cerebritis
               along with new early abscess. Given these findings, his
               antibiotics were changed to meropenem and the amphotericin B
               dose was increased. He was recommended debridement and sinus
               surgery but refused. During the course of treatment, he
               developed acute kidney injury and was switched to Posaconazole.
               Unfortunately, the patient decided to leave against medical
               advice 6 weeks into admission. He was advised to continue
               Posaconazole and levofloxacin but he could only afford
               levofloxacin. He was then recommended long-term levofloxacin. He
               has since recovered, with resolution of cerebritis noted in
               follow-up imaging 1 year later. CONCLUSIONS Our patient had mild
               COVID-19 infection and presented with secondary infective
               complications, which are usually associated with an
               immunocompromised state, despite receiving no
               immunosuppressives. It is imperative that all clinicians
               treating COVID-19 be watchful for fungal or bacterial
               co-infections in patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection, even
               if the presenting symptoms are mild, particularly if other risk

               mortality is seen among elderly and other at-risk populations

               suspected patients at hospitals, patients should be isolated and
               PPE should be worn by all health staff when in contact with the
               patients. Additionally, patients are tested for the presence of
               SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR, and blood samples are drawn. Imaging is
               not pivotal for the diagnosis, but chest X-ray is a relevant

               opportunity to navigate the pandemic. However, the advent of new
               genetic COVID-19 variants has increased more attention
               representing a worrying threat not only for not vaccinated but
               also for vaccinated people as virus infections have been shown
               also in the last ones. Herein, we report different clinical
               cases and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in six
               fully vaccinated patients. Two patients had a history of
               Rituximab therapy for follicular lymphoma and with persistent
               positivity for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal
               (NP/OP) swabs and with moderate pneumonia on the chest computed
               tomography (CT). One patient who resulted to be positive to
               delta variant 8 days after the second vaccination dose, died
               shortly after. Two patients were hospitalized due to the
               worsening of fever and dyspnea in presence of mild pneumonia on
               CT. In one patient mild pneumonia was found on the chest-CT
               performed after a lipothymic episode associated with chest pain
               and positive NP/OP swab tested for SARS-CoV-2. These data
               suggested that in fully vaccinated people, caution should be
               preserved, and the use of masks and social distancing should be
               continued in all closed environments. However, further clinical
               trials should be done to better understand how various factors
               can influence vaccine immunogenicity as the presence of virus
               mutations, age factors, and the presence of an immunocompromised
               state.",

               by COVID-19 than adults, accounting for 1\% to 5\% of all
               COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pande mic has challenged pediatric
               kidney transplant programs to provide safe and consistent care
               during this difficult and unprecedented time. So far during this
               pandemic, best practices being delivered to pediatric kidney
               transplant patients are based on available information from
               published literature and expert opinions. The key areas of
               pediatric kidney transplant care that may be affected by the
               COVID-19 pandemic include transplant activity, outpatient clinic
               activity, monitoring, multidisciplinary care, medications
               (immunosuppression and others), patient/family
               education/support, school and employment, and care of pediatric
               kidney transplant patients who are COVID-19 positive. It has
               been presumed that children with chronic kidney disease and/or
               those who take immunosuppressants may be at increased risk for
               complications from COVID-19 infection; however, available
               evidence has now suggested that immunosuppressed children with
               kidney transplant are not at increased risk of severe COVID-19
               disease. Clinicians should remain aware that transplant
               recipients may present with atypical symptoms. In addition,
               because evidence-based reports to support specific adjustments
               to immunosuppressive medications in relation to COVID-19 are not
               yet available, decisions on reduction or discontinuation of
               immunosuppression should be on a case-by-case basis for kidney
               transplant recipients who are COVID-19 positive. Reports to
               support evidence-based management of pediatric kidney transplant
               patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking; therefore,

  abstract  = "Background: Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is evolving continuously
               with emergence of several variants of increasing transmission
               capabilities and pandemic potential. Generation of variants
               occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature
               of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection
               pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of
               SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without
               mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the
               virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem
               disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm.
               Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation,
               infection in various organs, and host response to emerging
               variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies
               have reported underlying diseases including diabetes,
               hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders,
               and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for
               severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are
               also highly predominant in the population, which can alter
               COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response.
               We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host
               response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases.
               Methods: In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and
               characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of
               infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation
               with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in
               pre-existing liver and GI diseases. Key Findings: Emerging
               variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility
               and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality.
               There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the
               next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including
               alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma
               (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The
               mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for
               increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape
               (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver
               and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and
               distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease
               TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and
               cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to
               pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or
               prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of
               SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient's
               stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the
               GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic
               decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure
               may change the disease outcomes. Conclusions: The changes in the
               spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral
               proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in
               pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response
               to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.",

  author    = "Scribano, Maria Lia",
  abstract  = "The COVID-19 pandemic has created a public health emergency. In
               this context, there are major concerns for patients with
               inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly for those treated
               with immunomodulators, biologics, and Janus Kinase inhibitors.
               Infection susceptibility is, in fact, one of the reported risks
               for immunotherapy drugs. This review provides the existing
               evidence from worldwide case series describing: (a) the risk for
               the SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the risk of a severe infection
               outcome in patients with IBD treated with immunotherapy.
               Further, the review discusses the potential mechanisms
               underlying why this group of patients with IBD might be
               protected from contracting the infection and from a worse
               disease. From the available data, it appears that these patients
               should have an enhanced adherence to the recommended preventive
               measures, suggesting a role in reducing their risk of infection.
               Furthermore, the immunotherapy may dampen the cytokine storm and
               inflammation associated with COVID-19. The results of this
               review seem to confirm that patients with IBD receiving
               immunomodulators, biologics, or Janus Kinase inhibitors do not
               have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or
               develop a more severe COVID-19. According to the current
               evidence, it is advisable to maintain immunotherapy, apart from
               corticosteroids, in patients with IBD in order to avoid relapse.
               This review reports only on the cases of patients who tested
               positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab
               sample. This is a limitation and a more accurate epidemiological
               picture of the infection will be obtained only via the expanded

               receiving immunosuppressive therapies for neuroimmunologic
               disorders had (1) increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV2
               infection or to develop more severe forms of COVID-19; (2)
               increased relapses or autoimmune complications if infected; and
               (3) changes in health care delivery during the pandemic.
               METHODS: Patients with and without immunosuppressive treatment
               were recruited to participate in a retrospective survey
               evaluating the period from March 14, 2020, to March 30, 2021.
               Demographics, clinical features, type of immunosuppressive
               treatment, suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the patients or
               cohabitants, and changes in care delivery were recorded.
               RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three children were included: 84
               (55\%) female, median age 13 years (interquartile range [8-16]
               years), 79 (52\%) on immunosuppressive treatment. COVID-19 was
               suspected or confirmed in 17 (11\%) (all mild), with a frequency
               similar in patients with and without immunosuppressive treatment
               (11/79 [14\%] vs 6/74 [8\%], p = 0.3085). The frequency of
               neurologic relapses was similar in patients with (18\%) and
               without (21\%) COVID-19. Factors associated with COVID-19
               included having cohabitants with COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and lower
               blood levels of vitamin D (p = 0.039). Return to face-to-face
               schooling or mask type did not influence the risk of infection,
               although 43(28\%) children had contact with a classmate with
               COVID-19. Clinic visits changed from face to face to remote for
               120 (79\%) patients; 110 (92\%) were satisfied with the change.
               DISCUSSION: In this cohort of children with neuroimmunologic
               disorders, the frequency of COVID-19 was low and not affected by
               immunosuppressive therapies. The main risk factors for

               recipients over the past year and to identify key knowledge gaps
               for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Immunocompromised
               individuals and those with chronic health conditions are
               especially susceptible to infections, which have had a
               disproportionate impact on health outcomes during the COVID-19
               pandemic. Several studies have evaluated the clinical
               characteristics and outcomes of transplant and cellular therapy
               (TCT) recipients who developed COVID-19. Age, sex, comorbid
               conditions, and social determinants of health are important
               predictors of the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2 infection and of the eventual severity of the
               disease. Various treatment approaches have been investigated
               over the last year. The paradigm of management strategies
               continues to evolve as more experience is accumulated. SUMMARY:
               In this review, we summarize some important findings as they
               relate to the clinical characteristics of TCT recipients who
               develop COVID-19. We also discuss some treatment approaches that

               growing global health concern and are a major cause of death in
               immunocompromised patients. Worryingly, coronavirus disease-19
               (COVID-19) resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome has
               been shown to predispose some patients to airborne fungal
               co-infections. These include secondary pulmonary aspergillosis
               and mucormycosis. Aspergillosis is most commonly caused by the
               fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and primarily treated
               using the triazole drug group, however in recent years, this
               fungus has been rapidly gaining resistance against these
               antifungals. This is of serious clinical concern as multi-azole
               resistant forms of aspergillosis have a higher risk of mortality
               when compared against azole-susceptible infections. With the

               diagnostic methods to become a fast, reproducible, and
               cost-effective alternative for diagnosis of respiratory fungal
               pathogens and detection of antifungal resistance. Here, we
               describe what techniques are currently available within
               molecular diagnostics, how they work and when they have been

               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
               pandemic, which originated in China in 2019, has spread
               globally, infecting nearly 100 million people worldwide by
               January 2021. Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD),
               particularly cirrhosis, hepatobiliary malignancies, candidates
               for liver transplantation, and immunosuppressed individuals
               after liver transplantation appear to be at increased risk of
               infections in general, which in turn translates into increased
               mortality. This is also the case for SARS-CoV-2 infection, where
               patients with cirrhosis, in particular, are at high risk of a
               severe COVID-19 course. Therefore, vaccination against various
               pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, administered as early as
               possible in patients with CLD, is an important protective
               measure. However, due to impaired immune responses in these
               patients, the immediate and long-term protective response
               through immunisation may be incomplete. The current SARS-CoV-2
               pandemic has led to the exceptionally fast development of
               several vaccine candidates. A small number of these SARS-CoV-2
               vaccine candidates have already undergone phase III,
               placebo-controlled, clinical trials in healthy individuals with
               proof of short-term safety, immunogenicity and efficacy.
               However, although regulatory agencies in the US and Europe have
               already approved some of these vaccines for clinical use,
               information on immunogenicity, duration of protection and
               long-term safety in patients with CLD, cirrhosis, hepatobiliary
               cancer and liver transplant recipients has yet to be generated.
               This review summarises the data on vaccine safety,
               immunogenicity, and efficacy in this patient population in
               general and discusses the implications of this knowledge on the

               data are still limited in this patient group. Beyond the dosage
               of immunosuppressive drugs, pharmacological immunosuppression
               may also alter the infection response in the COVID-19 course.
               The effects of immunosuppressive agents on the development and

               how potent they are and how much they suppress the immune

               the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. There are data about

               exacerbate COVID-19. To evaluate immune dysregulation in
               different diseases, we used four separate datasets, including
               RNA-sequencing data from human left ventricular cardiac muscle
               samples of patients with dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy and
               healthy controls; RNA-sequencing data of whole blood samples
               from patients with single or recurrent event VTE and healthy
               controls; RNA-sequencing data of human peripheral blood
               mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with and without
               obstructive CAD; and RNA-sequencing data of platelets from

               dysregulation profiles between patients with CVDs and COVID-19
               patients. Interestingly, cardiomyopathy patients display the
               most similar immune landscape to COVID-19 patients.
               Additionally, COVID-19 patients experience greater upregulation
               of cytokine- and inflammasome-related genes than patients with
               CVDs. In all, patients with CVDs have a significant overlap of
               cytokine- and inflammasome-related gene expression profiles with
               that of COVID-19 patients, possibly explaining their greater

               response in naturally infected COVID-19 positive adolescent and
               young adult KTR. METHODS: For this prospective observational
               study, the study group included 38 KTR who received 2 doses of
               the tested vaccine, and the control group included 14 KTR who
               had a previous polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19

               serologic responses were observed in 63\% and 100\% of the study
               and control groups, respectively (P = 0.01). Antibody titers
               were almost 30-fold higher in the control than the study group
               (median [interquartile range (IQR)]: 2782 [1908-11 000] versus
               100.3 [4.7-1744] AU/mL, P < 0.001), despite the longer time from
               the COVID-19 infection to serologic testing compared to time
               from vaccination (median [IQR]: 157.5 [60-216] versus 37
               [20.5-53] d, P = 0.011). Among vaccinated patients, higher
               proportions of those seronegative than seropositive were
               previously treated with rituximab (50\% versus 8\%, P = 0.01).
               Time from the second vaccine dose to serologic testing was
               longer in seropositive than seronegative patients (median [IQR]:
               24.5 [15-40] versus 46 [27-56] d, P = 0.05). No patient
               developed symptomatic COVID-19 disease postvaccination.

               positive antibody response in adolescent and young adult KTR

               was 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 53--76) and 63\% were

               course of the first two waves (9.5\% and 10.2\%, respectively),
               whereas it decreased in the third wave (5.4\%). Overall
               mortality in patients without comorbidities was low at 1.6\%,

  abstract  = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge to
               global health, particularly among vulnerable populations. Here,
               we describe the emerging epidemiology and relevant data on
               treatment options for COVID-19. We discuss the implications of
               current knowledge for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients.
               RECENT FINDINGS: Risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 among SOT
               recipients remain uncertain, but recent data suggest similar
               outcomes to the general population. Case reports of
               donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 infection are emerging. Few studies on
               treatment of COVID-19 among SOT recipients are available, and
               therefore, general recommendations are similar to the general
               population. Vaccine efficacy in the SOT population is uncertain.
               SUMMARY: COVID-19 remains a significant threat to SOT recipients
               and studies on treatment and prevention specific to this
               population are urgently needed. Although vaccines represent the
               greatest hope to control this pandemic, their efficacy in this
               immunocompromised population is uncertain.",

              China, as a causative agent of severe pneumonia, known as

              a greater ease in acquiring the virus has been shown in the liver
              transplant population, without a difference in mortality when
              compared to the general population. Immunosuppression should
              continue at the minimum tolerated levels, without suspending
              calcineurin inhibitors. Of the specific treatment, steroids are
              those that have shown the greatest clinical benefit and decreased
              mortality. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation is not independently
              associated with higher mortality. Factors other than

               organ transplant (SOT) recipients are a heterogeneous population

               high risk of severe infections and an increased

              Pathologically confirmed varicella-like exanthem and perniosis
              COVID-19 cases have correlated with paucisymptomatic and
              asymptomatic patients in previous reports. We present the second
              case of biopsy-proven COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains
              (pernio) in a paucisymptomatic patient with a brisk perieccrine
              lymphocytic response. Based on an antecedent pathological study,
              we know coronavirus particles have been seen in the eccrine gland

              perieccrine inflammation is helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19

               production after vaccination with BNT162b2 and the protection
               from symptomatic breakthrough infections in health care workers.
               METHODS: This prospective observational study (RENAISSANCE) had
               as a primary end point the evaluation of serologic response to
               BNT162b2 14 days after a second dose. SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG
               antibodies were evaluated with LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG
               assay (DiaSorin S.p.A.), which is able to detect the presence of
               both binding and neutralizing antibodies for trimeric spike
               glycoprotein. Participants were recruited from February 1, 2021,
               to February 22, 2021. Occurrence of vaccine breakthrough
               infections was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase
               chain reaction on symptomatic and contact cases up to June 6,
               2021. RESULTS: Of 2569 staff evaluated, only 4 were
               nonresponders (0.16\%; 95\% CI, 0.04\% to 0.41\%). All 4
               nonresponders were severely immunosuppressed and receiving
               treatment with mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid. At 14
               days after the second dose, 67.5\% (1733) of staff had anti-S
               IgG titers of 2000 BAU/mL or higher; 19.2\% (494), between 1500
               and 2000 BAU/mL; 9.8\% (251), between 1000 and 1500 BAU/mL; and
               3.4\% (87), 1000 BAU/mL or lower. Women had a higher probability
               of having higher titers than men (64.5\% [1044/1618] vs 58.3\%
               [410/703]; P=.005). This was confirmed after adjustment for age
               group (odds ratio, 1.275; 95\% CI, 1.062 to 1.531; P=.009). Four
               months after the end of the vaccination program, only 13
               participants (0.26\%) had experienced a breakthrough SARS-CoV-2
               infection, including 1 nonresponder. This was the only
               participant requiring hospitalization for severe COVID-19.
               CONCLUSION: The vaccination campaign among health care workers
               at the ASST GOM Niguarda has resulted in a marked serologic
               response and reduction of incident COVID-19 cases. Yet, the lack

               up to 20\% of cases, COVID-19 infection can take a severe,
               life-threatening course. Therefore, preventive measures such as
               mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing are important.
               COVID-19 vaccines that use novel vaccine technology can prevent
               up to 95\% of infections. However, the uncertainty regarding the
               efficacy and safety of vaccination in patients with autoimmune
               inflammatory rheumatic disease (AIIRD), who are
               immunocompromised due to underlying immune dysfunction and

               available data and expert consensus. The currently available
               COVID-19 vaccines are considered to be safe and effective. Every
               patient with AIIRD should receive one of the available COVID-19
               vaccines unless contraindicated for medical reasons such as
               prior allergy/anaphylaxis to the COVID-19 vaccine or its
               components. Patients should continue immunosuppressive treatment
               for their underlying AIIRD, including biological and targeted
               synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs).
               Corticosteroids should be reduced to the lowest dose possible
               without aggravating the AIIRD. To improve the vaccine response,
               methotrexate can be withheld for 1-2 weeks after each
               vaccination, and the timing of rituximab and abatacept infusion
               should be adjusted if clinically acceptable. Rheumatologists

               inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who had been
               discharged or had died by October 1st, 2020. Characteristics of

               immunosuppressives and other treatment information was
               documented. Results: Twenty patients were included in this
               study, of whom 18 were discharged and 2 died in hospital. The
               mean duration of hospitalization and follow-up were 9.7 $\pm$
               6.4 days and 4.5 $\pm$ 2.0 months, respectively. Fourteen
               patients (70\%) were male and mean age was 48.0 $\pm$ 10.3
               years. At admission, all had immunosuppression withdrawn and
               were started on methylprednisolone 16 mg/ day (50\%) or
               dexamethasone (50\%). Tacrolimus/m-TOR inhibitors were reduced
               by 50\% and all antimetabolites were discontinued. Hemodialysis
               was needed for 10\% of patients. Acute kidney injury was
               detected in 25\% of the patients. With respect to
               hospitalization time and complications, there was no significant
               difference between patients who used dexamethasone and those who
               did not (P > 0.05). The discontinued immunosuppressives were
               resumed within 2 to 4 weeks after discharge according to the
               severity of disease. No rehospitalization or acute rejection was

               transplant patients are considered a high risk group for
               COVID-19. It can be said that discontinuation or reducing

               reported over the last months, this review aims at summarizing

               disease 2019 (COVID-19) on hematopoietic stem cell transplant
               (HSCT) recipients in terms of epidemiology, clinical features,
               and outcome. RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of COVID-19 in
               institutional cohorts varied according to different regions and
               study periods from 0.4\% to 8.3\%. Clinical presentation was
               overall comparable to other immunocompromised hosts and the
               general population. Microbiologically confirmed superinfection
               occurred in 13-25\% of recipients, with most episodes due to
               hospital-acquired bacteria and few reported cases of
               COVID-19-associated aspergillosis. Prolonged nasopharyngeal
               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 shedding has
               been demonstrated for as long as 210 days. Mortality rates were
               similar across studies (14.8-28.4\%) and did not markedly differ
               from those observed in nontransplant hematological patients
               during the first wave. Older age and shorter time from
               transplantation were associated with mortality, as well as
               underlying disease status and amount of immunosuppression. No
               outcome differences were found in most studies between
               allogeneic and autologous procedures. SUMMARY: Considerable
               advances have been achieved in the characterization of COVID-19

               safety and efficacy. Preliminary data about specific and
               neutralizing antibodies is available covering the first 100 days
               after vaccination. Methods: We reviewed all the publications
               regarding the immunologic consequences of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273
               vaccination. A summary of specific antibodies concentration and
               neutralizing antibodies titers elicited by each vaccine is
               provided. Results: BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 displayed a reassuring
               safety and efficacy profile, with the latter above 94\%. They
               can elicit specific antibodies titers and neutralizing
               antibodies concentrations that are far superior from those
               observed among COVID-19 human convalescent serum, across a wide
               span of age, for at least 100 days after vaccination. Moreover,
               the vaccine-induced T cellular response is oriented toward a TH1

               (COVID-19) pandemic, the medical community has faced major
               challenges that affect disease management in all areas.
               Dermatologists and immunologists have to choose appropriate
               treatment strategy taking into consideration the risk of
               infection and possible exacerbation of the course of the disease
               in patients with confirmed infection. Management of atopic
               dermatitis (AD) in moderate to severe cases is based on systemic
               therapy such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate and
               dupilumab.Areas covered: A literature search in PubMed database
               was performed until 6 March 2021. In this review, the authors
               discuss non-biologic and biologic systemic medications for AD
               and provide an overview of therapeutic recommendations during
               COVID-19 pandemic.Expert opinion: In case of an active COVID-19
               infection, conventional systemic treatment and biological
               treatment needs to be stopped until clinical recovery.
               Noninfected patients with systemic treatment of AD should
               continue their therapy via self-application. The authors can

               Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may allow secondary fungal
               disease through a propensity to cause respiratory infection by
               affecting the immune system leading to dysregulation and reduced
               numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+T, and CD8+T cells, altering the
               innate immunity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
               incidence of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) in
               COVID-19 patients. METHODOLOGY: Data for acute invasive
               rhinosinusitis was obtained from the Otorhinolaryngology
               departments at our tertiary hospital at the period from January
               2017 to December 2020. Then the risk factors of comorbid
               diseases and fungal types between post-COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
               groups regarding the incidence of AIFRS are compared. RESULTS:
               Consequently, the incidence of AIFRS showed a more significant
               difference (P < 0.05) in post-COVID-19 patients than in

               Immunocompromised patients, including solid organ transplant

              referred to as the covid-19, has been a threat to the global
              health as well as the world economy. It all started from the
              Wuhan city of china in December 2019, when a cluster of pneumonia
              cases with severe acute respiratory symptoms were reported with
              unknown etiology, majority of cases linked to the exposure to
              wholesale seafood market in Hunan. On January 7th, after the
              nomenclature of this causative agent was done as Corona Virus
              Disease 2019, COVID19, the struggles to combat and try to control
              this illness have only so far been less helpful as more and more
              countries have exponential proportion of cases. On the other side
              of the illness are the efforts being done constantly to study the
              characteristics of the virus, newer treatment agents, expanding
              testing facilities and finally to find a vaccine as soon as
              possible. Although most human coronavirus infections are mild,
              the epidemics of the two beta corona viruses, severe acute
              respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East
              respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)20-24 have caused more
              than 10 000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with
              mortality rates of 10\% for SARS-CoV and 37\% for MERS-CoV. The
              2019-nCoV has features typical of the coronavirus family and was
              classified in the beta coronavirus. Four viruses - (HCoV 229E,
              NL63, OC43, and HKU1) are endemic globally and account for 10\%
              to 30\% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and
              typically cause common cold symptoms in immunocompetent
              individuals. Currently, the patients infected by the novel
              coronavirus are the main source of infection. Although
              asymptomatic infected can also be a source. Transmission of the
              virus happens mainly through respiratory droplets and close
              contact (defined as that within 1m distance and lasting for
              several minutes). A possibility of aerosol transmission in a
              relatively closed environment for a long-time exposure to high
              concentrations has also not been denied as of yet. Since the
              information regarding the illness, the treatment principles have
              been in constant scrutiny and have been changed dynamically as we
              get to know more about the virus, studies of covid19 cases would
              be a major stepping stone in acquiring maximum if not hundred
              percent knowledge about covid19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An
              observational retrospective case study was done for a fixed

               current pandemic. Countries with higher prevalence of exposed
               obese individuals experienced the highest number of mortalities.
               The analysis also proved that individuals having more adipose
               tissue in body have a higher level of angiotensin-converting
               enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is identified as functional receptor for
               COVID-19. Therefore, obese individuals are worse in condition
               because of a higher presence of adiposity increases the number
               of ACE2 expressing cells. Furthermore, in silico interactions of
               ACE2 and different variants of coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) spike S1

               the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rapidly spread
               across the world in late 2019, leading to a pandemic. While
               SARS-CoV-2 infections predominately affect the respiratory
               system, severe infections can lead to renal and cardiac injury
               and even death. Due to its highly transmissible nature and
               severe health implications, animal models of SARS-CoV-2 are
               critical to developing novel therapeutics and preventatives.
               Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are an ideal animal model
               of SARS-CoV-2 infections because they recapitulate many aspects
               of human infections. After inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, hamsters
               become moribund, lose weight, and show varying degrees of
               respiratory disease, lethargy, and ruffled fur.
               Histopathologically, their pulmonary lesions are consistent with
               human infections including interstitial to broncho-interstitial
               pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage and edema, and granulocyte
               infiltration. Similar to humans, the duration of clinical signs
               and pulmonary pathology are short lived with rapid recovery by
               14 d after infection. Immunocompromised hamsters develop more
               severe infections and mortality. Preclinical studies in hamsters
               have shown efficacy of therapeutics, including convalescent
               serum treatment, and preventatives, including vaccination, in
               limiting or preventing clinical disease. Although hamster
               studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the
               pathogenesis and progression of disease after SARS-CoV-2
               infection, additional studies are required to better
               characterize the effects of age, sex, and virus variants on
               clinical outcomes in hamsters. This review aims to describe key

               patients who attended hospital during the peak of the pandemic
               and had a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS:
               Sixty-six patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.
               Twenty percent were treated as outpatients, 59\% were admitted
               to the general ward, and 21\% required intensive care. Treatment
               consisted of reduced immunosuppression, antibiotics for
               pneumonia or sepsis, and other supportive treatments. Within our
               cohort, 12 patients died (18\%), with an overall mortality of
               0.4\%. Predictive risk factors for COVID-19 severity were
               explored. CONCLUSIONS: Severe disease was associated with lower
               hemoglobin prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and lower lymphocyte
               count at the time of diagnosis but not age, sex, ethnicity, or
               preexisting comorbidities. Lower glomerular filtration rate and
               higher C-reactive protein were associated with more severe
               disease. Despite no use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin,
               antiviral, or immunomodulatory medications, our mortality rate
               (kidney and pancreas transplant patients) is similar to current
               international rates.",

  abstract  = "The severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus‑2
               (SARS‑CoV‑2) poses a threat to human life worldwide. Since early
               March, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), characterized
               by an acute and often severe form of pneumonia, has been
               declared a pandemic. This has led to a boom in biomedical
               research studies at all stages of the pipeline, from the in
               vitro to the clinical phase. In line with this global effort,
               known drugs, currently used for the treatment of other
               pathologies, including antivirals, immunomodulating compounds
               and antibodies, are currently used off‑label for the treatment
               of COVID‑19, in association with the supportive standard care.
               Yet, no effective treatments have been identified. A new hope
               stems from medical oncology and relies on the use of
               immune‑checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In particular, amongst the
               ICIs, antibodies able to block the programmed death‑1 (PD‑1)/PD
               ligand-1 (PD‑L1) pathway have revealed a hidden potential. In
               fact, patients with severe and critical COVID‑19, even prior to
               the appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome, exhibit
               lymphocytopenia and suffer from T‑cell exhaustion, which may
               lead to viral sepsis and an increased mortality rate. It has
               been observed that cancer patients, who usually are
               immunocompromised, may restore their anti‑tumoral immune
               response when treated with ICIs. Moreover, viral-infected mice
               and humans, exhibit a T‑cell exhaustion, which is also observed
               following SARS‑CoV‑2 infection. Importantly, when treated with
               anti‑PD‑1 and anti‑PD‑L1 antibodies, they restore their T‑cell
               competence and efficiently counteract the viral infection. Based
               on these observations, four clinical trials are currently open,
               to examine the efficacy of anti‑PD‑1 antibody administration to
               both cancer and non‑cancer individuals affected by COVID‑19. The
               results may prove the hypothesis that restoring exhausted
               T‑cells may be a winning strategy to beat SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.",

              (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel member of the coronavirus family that
              caused the global coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The
              prevalence remains largely unknown because of early testing
              supply shortages. Although it cannot currently be used to
              determine level of immunity, antibody testing can contribute to
              epidemiological studies, identify convalescent plasma donors, or
              satisfy curiosity about previous exposure to the virus. METHODS:
              407 samples collected from hospitalized inpatients with and
              without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 170 remnant clinical
              specimens collected and frozen prior to the COVID-19 outbreak,
              and paired serum and plasma samples from 23 convalescent plasma
              donors were used to determine performance characteristics of the
              Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays.
              The sensitivity, specificity, imprecision, interferences, and
              sample stability were determined. These assays were then used to
              characterize the antibody response in serial samples from 20
              SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients. RESULTS: Both assays exhibited
              100\% specificity (95\% CI; 99.05-100.00), giving no positive
              results in 170 specimens collected before July 2019 and 215
              specimens from patients without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
              Differences between platforms were most notable in SARS-CoV-2
              positive samples. Roche offered higher sensitivity in
              convalescent plasma donors at 95.7\% (95\% CI; 78.1-99.9) versus
              91.3\% (95\% CI; 72.0-98.9) but Abbott detected antibodies in 2
              immunocompromised patients whereas Roche did not. The Roche and
              Abbott platforms also exhibited different trends in antibody
              signal for a subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Abbott and
              Roche platforms offer excellent specificity but different trends
              in antibody signal may reflect qualitative differences in the
              types of antibodies recognized by the 2 assays. Negative
              serologic results do not exclude previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

               intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to enhance immunity. For
               moderate or severe patients, the immunosuppressive agents were
               largely reduced or even interrupted, low-dose IVIG was adopted,

               associated with hospitalization and other clinical outcomes.
               METHODS: Adult patients who received monoclonal antibody from 19
               November 2020 to 11 February 2021 were selected and divided into
               those who received bamlanivimab (n = 2747) and

               COVID-19-related hospitalizations were compared between the
               groups. RESULTS: The population included 3596 patients; the
               median age was 62 years, and 50\% were female. All had $\geq$1

               and COVID-19-related hospitalization rates at 28 days were
               3.98\% and 2.56\%, respectively. After adjusting for medical

               of these three products in preventing COVID-19 hospitalization,

               for severe COVID-19 in February 2020. He suffered an acute lung

              their immunocompromised state resulting from the use of
              disease-modifying treatments. METHODS: Retrospective and
              multicenter registry in patients with MS with suspected or
              confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and available disease course (mild =
              ambulatory; severe = hospitalization; and critical = intensive
              care unit/death). Cases were analyzed for associations between MS
              characteristics and COVID-19 course and for identifying risk
              factors for a fatal outcome. RESULTS: Of the 326 patients
              analyzed, 120 were cases confirmed by real-time PCR, 34 by a
              serologic test, and 205 were suspected. Sixty-nine patients
              (21.3\%) developed severe infection, 10 (3\%) critical, and 7
              (2.1\%) died. Ambulatory patients were higher in relapsing MS
              forms, treated with injectables and oral first-line agents,
              whereas more severe cases were observed in patients on pulsed
              immunosuppressors and critical cases among patients with no
              therapy. Severe and critical infections were more likely to
              affect older males with comorbidities, with progressive MS forms,
              a longer disease course, and higher disability. Fifteen of 33
              patients treated with rituximab were hospitalized. Four deceased
              patients have progressive MS, 5 were not receiving MS therapy,
              and 2 were treated (natalizumab and rituximab). Multivariate
              analysis showed age (OR 1.09, 95\% CI, 1.04-1.17) as the only
              independent risk factor for a fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This
              study has not demonstrated the presumed critical role of MS
              therapy in the course of COVID-19 but evidenced that people with
              MS with advanced age and disease, in progressive course, and
              those who are more disabled have a higher probability of severe
              and even fatal disease.",

               Methods: An online interview questionnaire concerning the
               acceptance or hesitancy toward vaccination for COVID-19 was
               designed and 543 patients with IBD in China were invited to
               complete the structured self-administered anonymous
               questionnaire. Results: Of all the participants, 50.7\% were
               indecisive about the vaccination and only 16.0\% opted for it.
               Vaccination hesitancy was significantly associated with women
               and those without medical or biomedical backgrounds. The
               acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination was higher in participants
               with no history of immune-modifying therapies, especially in
               those without immunosuppressants. Participants who considered
               vaccination critically important to self-health or the health of
               others were more likely to choose immediately or later

               chain reaction (PCR)-based assays for common respiratory

               (BAL) samples than upper airway specimens in immunocompromised
               patients. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted reviewing
               patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Medical College of
               Wisconsin (Milwaukee, WI, USA) between March 13, 2020 and June
               11, 2020. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via
               real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), through a
               nasopharyngeal or a bronchoscopy specimen. RESULTS: During the
               study period, 53 bronchoscopy procedures were performed at the
               institution, of which five patients tested positive for
               COVID-19. Of the five patients, three underwent BAL testing
               based on high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 after the
               nasopharyngeal (NP) swab(s) was negative. All three patients had
               underlying cancers and had lymphopenia for a considerable
               duration prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19. Two patients
               had better outcomes that could be attributed to earlier BAL
               specimen testing resulting in timely medical intervention.
               CONCLUSION: This study underscores the need for early lower
               respiratory tract sampling, whenever possible, in patients with
               cancer and prolonged lymphopenia. High clinical suspicion ought
               to supersede false-negative NP reverse transcriptase-PCR as
               early bronchoscopic evaluation in cancer patients, who are
               either receiving active treatment or are immunosuppressed, can
               allow timely institution of efficacious treatment, enrollment

               the apt clinical setting in patients with cancer, presumptive

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
               immunocompromised patients are at a higher risk of severe
               infection, since the immune system has an important role in
               defeating this disease. This study compares the severity of
               COVID-19 in patients taking methotrexate with the severity of
               their family members' illness as patients with normal immune
               system function. METHODS: A total of 35 participants, including
               14 patients taking methotrexate and 21 patients with normal
               immune function, entered this study, and the indicators of
               COVID-19 severity were compared between these two groups.
               RESULTS: The case group, who were on methotrexate therapy, had
               significantly less severe COVID-19 based on their symptoms,
               including fever (p = 0.000) and cough and dyspnea (p = 0.01) as
               well as in terms of COVID-19 severity indicators such as
               pulmonary involvement (p = 0.001), ferritin level (p = 0.001),
               white blood cell count (p = 0.008) and CRP level (p = 0.006),
               compared to the control group. There was a significant
               correlation between taking methotrexate and lower severity in
               COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: The present findings demonstrated
               that methotrexate does not predispose patients to severe
               COVID-19; on the contrary, patients taking methotrexate may
               experience a milder disease, possibly due to their reduced
               severe inflammatory reactions as a result of inhibited
               TNF$\alpha$, lowered IL6, and increased T regulatory cells.
               According to these findings, methotrexate appears to be a
               suitable treatment option for patients who need
               immunosuppressive medications during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

               and identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in
               children. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study among
               children with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March to July 2020 at
               Children's Hospital Colorado. Risk factors for severe disease
               were analyzed as defined by hospital admission, respiratory
               support, or critical care. Univariable and multivariable
               analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Among 454 patients identified
               with SARS-CoV-2, 191 (42.1\%) were females, median age 11 years.
               Fifty-five percent of all patients identified as Hispanic
               compared with 29\% among all hospital visits in 2019 (P 20 years

               gastrointestinal condition, and similar symptoms at presentation
               were also predictors for respiratory support. Elevated
               C-reactive protein was associated with the need for critical
               care with median of 17.7 mg/dL (IQR, 5.3-22.9) versus 1.95 mg/dL
               (IQR, 0.7-5.5) among patients requiring critical versus no
               critical care (OR, 1.2; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Extremes of age,
               comorbid conditions, and elevated CRP are predictors of severe
               disease in children. Findings from this study can inform
               pediatric providers and public health officials to tailor
               clinical management, pandemic planning, and resource allocation.",

              networks that exist to improve the understanding of RSV disease.

              unmet need for patients with hematological malignancies requiring
              specialized procedures and treatments, like cellular therapy to
              treat or cure their disease. For instance, chimeric antigen
              receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is approved for
              relapsed/refractory (after two or more lines of therapy) diffuse
              large B cell lymphoma and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
              that is refractory or in the second relapse in patients younger
              than 25 years of age. Similarly, hematopoietic stem cell
              transplantation (HSCT) can be a lifesaving procedure for many
              patients, such as those with acute myeloid leukemia with
              high-risk cytogenetics. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has
              thrust upon the hematologists and transplant specialists' unique
              challenges with the implementation and management of cellular
              therapy. One of the significant concerns regarding this
              immunocompromised patient population is the significant risk of
              acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its highly contagious
              nature. Experts have recommended that if medically indicated,
              especially in high-risk disease (where chemotherapy is unlikely
              to work), these lifesaving procedures should not be delayed even
              during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, proceeding with CAR-T cell
              therapy and HSCT during the pandemic is a considerable task and
              requires dedication from the transplant team and buy-in from the
              patients and their family or support system. Open conversations
              should be held with the patients about the risks involved in

               is the most effective strategy in the fight against pandemic.
               Vaccines can be administered with different natural biological
               products (adjuvants) with immunomodulating properties. Adjuvants
               can be taken orally, complementing vaccine action. Adjuvant
               compounds could play a key role in alleviating the symptoms of
               the disease, as well as in enhancing vaccine action. Adjuvants
               also contribute to an effective immune response and can enhance
               the protective effect of vaccines in immunocompromised
               individuals such as the elderly. Adjuvants must not produce
               adverse effects, toxicity, or any other symptoms that could
               alter immune system function. Vaccine adjuvants are substances
               of wide varying chemical structure that are used to boost the
               immune response against a simultaneously administered antigen.
               Glucans could work as adjuvants due to their immunomodulatory
               biological activity. In this respect, $\beta$-(1,3)-(1,6)
               glucans are considered the most effective and safe according to
               the list issued by the European Commission. Only glucans with a
               $\beta$-(1,3) bond linked to a $\beta$-(1,6) are considered
               modulators of certain biological responses. The aim of this
               review is to present the possible effects of $\beta$-glucans as
               adjuvants in the efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

               aimed to analyze data associated with the development of
               pneumonia in children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection
               throughout Mexico. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of
               the database of the Direcci{\'o}n General de Epidemiolog{\'\i}a
               of the Mexican Government. We included children under the age of
               19 who were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse
               transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The
               dependent variable was the diagnosis of pneumonia. Odds ratios
               (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated.
               Multiple logistic regression models were performed to adjust
               factors associated with pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 1443
               children with a COVID-19 diagnosis were included. The median age
               of the participants was 12 years (interquartile range 25, 75: 5,
               16). Pneumonia occurred in 141 children (9.8\%). The main risk

               (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic led to a worldwide medical crisis,
               affecting mostly immunocompromised patients, such as cancer
               patients. Various cancer societies have issued recommendations
               regarding patients care, but few studies addressed the
               perception of cancer patients regarding this pandemic.
               OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the perception of
               cancer patients regarding their health risks during this
               pandemic and the preventive measures taken. MATERIALS AND
               METHODS: An anonymous survey was conducted among cancer patients
               presenting for their treatment, during 10 consecutive working
               days, at the one-day clinic of Hotel-Dieu de France University
               hospital in Beirut. We evaluated their state of disease,
               comorbidities, precautions taken, and their concerns regarding
               the virus spread. RESULTS: A total of 216 patients responded
               with a mean age of 60 years. The majority had a good performance
               status (performance status = 0-1 in 79.6\%), 51.4\% had
               metastatic disease, and chemotherapy was the main therapy used
               (65.7\%). A total of 52.3\% of patients considered themselves to
               be at increased risk of contracting the virus. A total of 55.1\%
               were more worried about the coronavirus rather than their
               disease. The priority was for the treatment of their cancer in
               47.7\% of the total patients studied. Of note, only 2.8\% of
               planned one-day clinic reservations were canceled or postponed
               to avoid COVID-19 exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although cancer is a
               disease with a high mortality rate, many patients are more
               concerned about the actual pandemic rather than their disease.
               Nevertheless, the absenteeism from their treatment sessions

               adults with moderate to severe potentially life-threatening
               pemphigus vulgaris. Recent studies have focused on assessments
               of efficacy and safety of low-dose rituximab (<2 gram in each
               cycle). METHOD: Databases were searched from 2010 to 2020 (last
               update: 1 June 2020). RESULT: Nine studies were entered;
               including180 cases (92: women, 88: men, age range: 9-83 years).
               The dosages of each Rituximab cycle varied between
               ultra-low-dose ($\leq$500 mg for a cycle, either multiple
               infusions or a single infusion), low-dose (2 $\times$ 375 mg/m2
               or 2 $\times$ 500 mg) and modified-dose (3 $\times$ 375 mg/m2 or
               3 $\times$ 500 mg). The efficacy and safety of Rituximab in the
               studies are known by the recovery time, relapse time, and side
               events. According to the studies, 2 $\times$ 500 can lead to
               complete remission in a broad range, from 35 to 82\%. These
               differences might be explained by different end-points and
               variable cumulative corticosteroid dosage after RTX
               administration. Although the studies showed that low dose RTX is
               efficient, there are some controversies regarding the choosing
               low-dose for severe patients. CONCLUSION: Considering the
               effectiveness of low-dose, intermediate dose, and ultra-low-dose
               protocols of Rituximab in inducing remission in pemphigus
               disease and considering factors such as cost of therapy, and the
               need to induce a minimum of immunosuppression for a minimum
               duration in the COVID-19 pandemic, suggested to use low-dose
               Rituximab protocol (2 infusions of 500 mg Rituximab: interval of
               2 weeks) to induce the remission in mild-to-moderate pemphigus

               in immunocompromised patients can trigger the accumulation of an
               unusual high number of mutations with potential relevance at
               both biological and epidemiological levels. Here, we report a
               case of an immunocompromised patient (non-Hodgkin lymphoma
               patient under immunosuppressive therapy) with a persistent
               SARS-CoV-2 infection (marked by intermittent positivity) over at
               least 6 months. Viral genome sequencing was performed at days 1,
               164, and 171 to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Among the 15
               single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (11 leading to amino acid
               alterations) and 3 deletions accumulated during this long-term
               infection, four amino acid changes (V3G, S50L, N87S, and A222V)
               and two deletions (18-30del and 141-144del) occurred in the
               virus Spike protein. Although no convalescent plasma therapy was
               administered, some of the detected mutations have been
               independently reported in other chronically infected
               individuals, which supports a scenario of convergent adaptive
               evolution. This study shows that it is of the utmost relevance
               to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 evolution in immunocompromised
               individuals, not only to identify novel potentially adaptive
               mutations, but also to mitigate the risk of introducing
               ``hyper-evolved'' variants in the community. IMPORTANCE Tracking
               the within-patient evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is key to
               understanding how this pandemic virus shapes its genome toward
               immune evasion and survival. In the present study, by monitoring
               a long-term COVID-19 immunocompromised patient, we observed the
               concurrent emergence of mutations potentially associated with
               immune evasion and/or enhanced transmission, mostly targeting
               the SARS-CoV-2 key host-interacting protein and antigen. These
               findings show that the frequent oscillation in the immune status
               in immunocompromised individuals can trigger an accelerated
               virus evolution, thus consolidating this study model as an
               accelerated pathway to better understand SARS-CoV-2 adaptive
               traits and anticipate the emergence of variants of concern.",

               severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in
               Croatian SOTRs. Materials and methods: From 7 September to 27
               November 2020 (beginning of the second COVID-19 pandemic wave),
               a cross-sectional screening for COVID-19 was performed in the
               adult outpatient liver (LTRs; N = 280) and kidney transplant
               recipients (KTRs; N = 232). Serum samples were initially tested
               for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked
               immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Vircell Microbiologists, Granada,
               Spain). All positive samples were confirmed using a virus
               neutralization test (VNT). Data on risk exposure and COVID-19
               related symptoms were collected using a questionnaire. Results:
               The transplanted cohort's seroprevalence detected by ELISA and
               VNT was 20.1\% and 3.1\%, respectively. Neutralizing (NT)
               antibodies developed in 15.6\% of anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG
               positive SOTRs. The difference in seropositivity rates between
               LTRs and KTRs was not statistically significant (ELISA 21.1\%
               vs. 19.0\%, P = 0.554; VNT 3.6\% vs. 2.6\%, P = 0.082). Overall
               VNT positivity rates were higher in patients who reported
               participation in large community events (5.9\% vs. 1.0\%; P =
               0.027) as well as in patients who reported COVID-19 related
               symptoms in the past six months. In addition, symptomatic VNT
               positive patients showed significantly higher (P = 0.031) NT
               antibody titers (median 128, interquartile range (IQR) = 32-128)
               compared to asymptomatic patients (median 16, IQR = 16-48).
               Conclusions: This study showed that 15.6\% of anti-SARS-CoV-2
               ELISA positive Croatian SOTRs developed NT antibodies indicating
               protective immunity. Further studies are needed to determine the

               involving the small bowel (SB) with a focus on recent literature
               related to diagnosis and pathophysiology. RECENT FINDINGS:
               Typical symptom for SB infections is diarrhea, mostly
               self-limiting. Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi,
               protozoan parasites, and helminths. Host-pathogen interaction is
               of special interest in infections with potentially severe or
               prolonged course. Research uses increasingly enterocyte cell
               culture systems. SARS-CoV2 can also infect enterocytes via
               angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and causes
               gastrointestinal complaints in some patients. Chronic SB
               infections as tuberculosis, Cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr
               virus have to be differentiated from Crohn's and other diseases.
               Severe rare fungal and protozoan parasitic infections can cause
               relevant morbidity in immunocompromised patients.
               Soil-transmitted helminthic infections are a special issue in
               endemic areas. SUMMARY: Many infections involve the SB,
               typically causing mild and self-limiting diarrhea. Symptomatic
               therapy, hygiene, and isolation are the mainstay of management.
               However, some patients develop severe or chronic disease.
               Immunosuppression is a major cause for severe, but also for rare
               opportunistic systemic infections that can also affect the SB.",

               factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes
               among Medicare beneficiaries during the pandemic's early phase.
               METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study covering Medicare
               fee-for-service beneficiaries, we separated out elderly
               residents in nursing homes (NHs) and those with end-stage renal
               disease (ESRD) from the primary study population of individuals
               age $\geq$65 years. Outcomes included COVID-19 hospital
               encounters and COVID-19-associated deaths. We estimated adjusted
               odds ratios (ORs) using logistic regression. RESULTS: We
               analyzed 25 333 329 elderly non-NH beneficiaries without ESRD,
               653 966 elderly NH residents, and 292 302 patients with ESRD.
               COVID-related death rates (per 10 000) were much higher among
               elderly NH residents (275.7) and patients with ESRD (60.8) than
               in the primary study population (5.0). Regression-adjusted
               clinical predictors of death among the primary population
               included immunocompromised status (OR, 1.43), frailty index
               conditions such as cognitive impairment (3.16), and other
               comorbid conditions, including congestive heart failure (1.30).
               Demographic-related risk factors included male sex (OR, 1.77),
               older age (3.09 for 80- vs 65-year-olds), Medicaid
               dual-eligibility status (2.17), and racial/ethnic minority.
               Compared with whites, ORs were higher for blacks (2.47),
               Hispanics (3.11), and Native Americans (5.82). Results for
               COVID-19 hospital encounters were consistent. CONCLUSIONS:
               Frailty, comorbid conditions, and race/ethnicity were strong

  abstract  = "The landscape in dentistry is changing as emerging studies
               continue to reveal that periodontal health impacts systemic
               health, and vice versa. Population studies, clinical studies,
               and in vitro animal studies underscore the critical importance
               of oral health to systemic health. These inextricable
               relationships come to the forefront as oral diseases, such as
               periodontal disease, take root. Special populations bring to
               bear the multimodal relationships between oral and systemic
               health. Specifically, periodontal disease has been associated
               with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, eating disorders,
               liver disease, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease,
               rheumatoid arthritis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and cancer.
               Although bidirectional relationships are recognized, the
               potential for multiple comorbidities, relationships, and
               connections (multimodal relationships) also exists. Proposed
               mechanisms that mediate this connection between oral and
               systemic health include predisposing and precipitating factors,
               such as genetic factors (gene polymorphisms), environmental
               factors (stress, habits-such as smoking and high-fat
               diets/consumption of highly processed foods), medications,
               microbial dysbiosis and bacteremias/viremias/microbemias, and an
               altered host immune response. Thus, in a susceptible host, these
               predisposing and precipitating factors trigger the onset of
               periodontal disease and systemic disease/conditions. Further,
               high-throughput sequencing technologies are shedding light on
               the dark matter that comprises the oral microbiome. This has
               resulted in better characterization of the oral microbial
               dysbiosis, including putative bacterial periodontopathogens and
               shifts in oral virome composition during disease. Multiple
               laboratory and clinical studies have illustrated that both
               eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses within subgingival plaque and
               periodontal tissues affect periodontal inflammation, putative
               periodontopathogens, and the host immune response. Although the
               association between herpesviruses and periodontitis and the
               degree to which these viruses directly aggravate periodontal
               tissue damage remain unclear, the benefits to periodontal health
               found from prolonged administration of antivirals in
               immunocompromised or immunodeficient individuals demonstrates
               that specific populations are possibly more susceptible to viral
               periodontopathogens. Thus, it may be important to further
               examine the implications of viral pathogen involvement in
               periodontitis and perhaps it is time to embrace the viral dark
               matter within the periodontal environment to fully comprehend
               the pathogenesis and systemic implications of periodontitis.
               Emerging data from the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic further
               underscores the inextricable connection between oral and
               systemic health, with high levels of the severe acute
               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 angiotensin-converting enzyme
               2 receptor noted on oral tissues (tongue) and an allostatic load
               or overload paradigm of chronic stress likely contributing to
               rapid breakdown of oral/dental, periodontal, and peri-implant
               tissues. These associations exist within a framework of
               viremias/bacteremias/microbemias, systemic inflammation, and/or
               disturbances of the immune system in a susceptible host. A
               thorough review of systemic and oral diseases and conditions and
               their mechanistic, predisposing, and precipitating factors are

               Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated acute liver injury (ALI)
               has been linked to poor outcomes in adults. Here we compare
               characteristics in children with elevated ALT (E-ALT) in two
               distinct manifestations of the infection, multisystem
               inflammatory syndrome-children (MIS-C) and coronavirus disease
               2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of
               patients $\leq$21 years of age with positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR.
               E-ALT was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L.
               Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were
               obtained to describe differences in children with and without
               E-ALT in COVID-19 and MIS-C. RESULTS: E-ALT was detected in 36\%
               of the 291 patients; 31\% with COVID-19, and 51\% with MIS-C.
               E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with obesity (P < .001),
               immunocompromised status (P = .04), and chronic liver disease (P
               = .01). In the regression models, E-ALT in COVID-19 was
               associated with higher c-reactive protein (OR 1.08, P = .01)
               after adjusting for common independent predictors. Children with
               E-ALT and MIS-C were more often boys (P = .001), Hispanic (P =
               .04), or Black (P < .001). In MIS-C, male gender (OR 5.3, P =
               .02) and Black race (OR 4.4, P = .04) were associated with
               increased odds of E-ALT. Children with E-ALT in both cohorts had
               significantly higher multiorgan dysfunction, longer
               hospitalization, and ICU stay. Children with MIS-C had 2.3-fold
               increased risk of E-ALT compared to COVID-19. No association was
               found between E-ALT and mortality. CONCLUSION: E-ALT with
               SARS-CoV-2 presents as elevated transaminases without hepatic
               synthetic dysfunction. Patients with either manifestation of

              where the virus replicates and mutates in a rather unlimited
              fashion, such as in immune compromised patients? The virus was
              shown to replicate in an immunosuppressed cancer patient for more
              than 105 days and might be a source of new variants. These
              patients are asymptomatic and the virus may therefore escape

               community hospitals in Georgia, United States, during March
               2020. Using standardized medical record abstraction, we

               COVID-19 who are undergoing exogenous immunosuppression.
               Specifically, we studied the antibody response of 3 solid organ

               fluticasone, and a patient on etanercept and daily inhaled
               fluticasone, and compared them to 5 patients not on exogenous

               regarding outcomes due to their immunosuppressed conditions.
               This study evaluated the general characteristics of kidney
               transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection. Among 1257
               transplant cases, 56 had COVID-19 infection, and 23 (41\%) were
               hospitalized during the 9-month study period. Among all COVID-19
               cases, 58\% were male with a mean age of 45.5 ($\pm$13.2, 19-71)
               years, and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension
               (70.9\%) and diabetes (23.6\%). Hospitalized patients were older
               (p = 0.03) and had higher rates of hypertension (p = 0.008),
               diabetes (p = 0.002), and ischemic heart disease (p = 0.03).
               Therapeutic management included antimetabolite withdrawal and
               prednisolone increase in 71\%, calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal
               in 8\% and decrease in 58\%, hydroxychloroquine in 17\%,
               tocilizumab in 3\%, and antivirals in 67\% of patients. Acute
               kidney injury and respiratory failure developed in 34\% and
               85\%, respectively. The mortality rate was 23\%. These results
               emphasized that the COVID-19 infection in renal transplant
               recipients significantly increases the risk of morbidity and
               mortality. Therefore, these patients should be intervened
               earlier and monitored closely to prevent poor outcomes.",

  abstract  = "The COVID-19 pandemic was officially declared on March 11th,
               2020. Since the very beginning, the spread of the virus has been
               tracked nearly in real-time by worldwide genome sequencing
               efforts. As of March 2021, more than 830,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
               have been uploaded in GISAID and this wealth of data allowed
               researchers to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during this
               first pandemic year. In parallel, nomenclatures systems, often
               with poor consistency among each other, have been developed to
               designate emerging viral lineages. Despite general fears that
               the virus might mutate to become more virulent or transmissible,
               SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has remained relatively low during
               the first ~ 8 months of sustained human-to-human transmission.
               At the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, though, some alarming
               events started to raise concerns of possible changes in the
               evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Specifically, three new
               viral variants associated with extensive transmission have been
               described as variants of concern (VOC). These variants were
               first reported in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and
               Brazil (P.1). Their designation as VOCs was determined by an
               increase of local cases and by the high number of amino acid
               substitutions harboured by these lineages. This latter feature
               is reminiscent of viral sequences isolated from
               immunocompromised patients with long-term infection, suggesting
               a possible causal link. Here we review the events that led to
               the identification of these lineages, as well as emerging data
               concerning their possible implications for viral phenotypes,
               reinfection risk, vaccine efficiency and epidemic potential.
               Most of the available evidence is, to date, provisional, but
               still represents a starting point to uncover the potential
               threat posed by the VOCs. We also stress that genomic
               surveillance must be strengthened, especially in the wake of the
               vaccination campaigns.",

              in immunocompromised hosts. Clinical presentation of mucormycosis
              is related to the underlying conditions; rhino-cerebral disease

               from three tracheal aspirates (days 7, 21, and 27) were compared
               at the sequence level. We identified a mixed viral population
               with five different S protein mutations (141 to 144 deletion,
               243 to 244 deletion, E484K, Q493K, and Q493R) at the NTD or RBD
               region from the second tracheal aspirate sample (day 21) and a
               predominance of the S protein 141 to 144 LGVY deletion and E484K

               in support of the endogenous development of neutralizing
               antibodies. The patient's compromised immune status, the
               antirejection regiment, convalescent plasma treatment, and the
               development of neutralizing antibodies may have resulted in
               unique selective pressures on the intrahost genomic evolution,
               and this observation supports the hypotheses that VOCs can
               independently arise and that immunocompromised patients on
               convalescent plasma therapy are potential breeding grounds for

               2 (SARS-CoV-2) lineages have arisen in multiple geographic areas

               B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma), and B.1.617.2
               (delta), harboring mutations and/or deletions in spike protein
               N-terminal domain (NTD) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) regions
               showed evidence of increased transmissibility and disease
               severity and possible reduced vaccine efficacy. In this study,

               a rare, highly fatal disease. This opportunistic fungal
               infection causes angioinvasion and ischemic tissue necrosis. It
               mainly affects immunocompromised patients. Since the coronavirus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, many case reports have
               described the rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis associated
               with COVID-19. However, the underlying predisposing factors are
               unknown. Several factors, other than diabetes, which is the most
               well-known contributing factor, may be involved in causing this
               severe fungal infection in COVID-19 patients. These factors may
               include steroid therapy, which is being used in severely
               dyspneic patients, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that
               may cause fungal flare-ups, and hospitalization with possible
               nosocomial infections. In addition, increased serum ferritin
               levels, possible endothelial damage, and pancreatic islets

               neck surgeons should be aware of the increasing prevalence of

               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) was declared a
               pandemic, it has spread rapidly, causing one of the most serious
               outbreaks in the last century. Reliable and rapid diagnostic
               tests for COVID-19 are crucial to control and manage the
               outbreak. Here, a label-free square wave voltammetry-based
               biosensing platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
               nasopharyngeal samples is reported. The sensor was constructed
               on screen-printed carbon electrodes coated with gold
               nanoparticles. The electrodes were functionalized using
               11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) which was used for the
               immobilization of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
               protein (N protein). The binding of the immunosensor with the N
               protein caused a change in the electrochemical signal. The
               detection was realised by measuring the change in reduction peak
               current of a redox couple using square wave voltammetry at 0.04
               V versus Ag ref. electrode on the immunosensor upon binding with
               the N protein. The electrochemical immunosensor showed high
               sensitivity with a linear range from 1.0 pg.mL-1 to 100 ng.mL-1
               and a limit of detection of 0.4 pg.mL-1 for the N protein in PBS
               buffer pH 7.4. Moreover, the immunosensor did not exhibit
               significant response with other viruses such as HCoV, MERS-CoV,
               Flu A and Flu B, indicating the high selectivity of the sensor
               for SARS-CoV-2. However, cross reactivity of the biosensor with
               SARS-CoV is indicated, which gives ability of the sensor to
               detect both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor was
               successfully applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical
               samples showing good correlation between the biosensor response
               and the RT-PCR cycle threshold values. We believe that the
               capability of miniaturization, low-cost and fast response of the
               proposed label-free electrochemical immunosensor will facilitate
               the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID 19 and help prevent further

               a few studies have addressed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicited
               immunity in this immunocompromised population. METHODS: We
               assessed immunogenicity of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in at-risk
               dialysis patients and characterised systemic cellular and
               humoral immune responses in serum and saliva using interferon
               $\gamma$ release assay and multiplex-based cytokine and
               immunoglobulin measurements. We further compared binding
               capacity and neutralization efficacy of vaccination-induced
               immunoglobulins against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha,
               Beta, Epsilon and Cluster 5 by ACE2-RBD competition assay.
               FINDINGS: Patients on maintenance haemodialysis exhibit
               detectable but variable cellular and humoral immune responses
               against SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern after a two-dose
               regimen of BNT162b2. Although vaccination-induced
               immunoglobulins were detectable in saliva and plasma, both
               anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralization efficacy was reduced
               compared to a vaccinated non-dialysed control population.
               Similarly, T-cell mediated interferon $\gamma$ release after
               stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides was significantly
               diminished. INTERPRETATION: Quantifiable humoral and cellular
               immune responses after BNT162b2 vaccination in individuals on
               maintenance haemodialysis are encouraging, but urge for
               longitudinal follow-up to assess longevity of immunity.
               Diminished virus neutralization and interferon $\gamma$
               responses in the face of emerging variants of concern may favour
               this at-risk population for re-vaccination using modified
               vaccines at the earliest opportunity. FUNDING: Initiative and

               described in December 2019 and has evolved into an ongoing
               global pandemic. Cancer patients on chemotherapy are
               immunocompromised and are at the highest risk of
               Covid-19-related complications. We describe our experience with
               the management of haematology-oncology and stem cell transplant
               (SCT) patients receiving curative chemotherapy in a hospital
               with a high influx of Covid-19 patients. Methods: . We did a
               prospective observational study at a 99-bedded cancer centre of
               a tertiary care teaching hospital from April 2020 to September
               2020. Preventive measures taken were categorized as follows: (i)
               staff: screening, mandatory use of personal protective equipment
               (PPE), risk stratification of potential exposure and testing and
               isolation as needed; (ii) patients: mandatory viral polymerase
               chain reaction testing, segregation of positive and untested
               patients and testing of family members; and (iii) environment:
               mandatory regular cleaning, visitor restriction, telemedicine
               services and reassignment of priority to clinic visits.
               Treatment of the underlying conditions was continued with added
               precautions. Results: . A total of 54 patients were included in
               the analysis, including 48 with haematological malignancies and
               6 for stem cell therapy. Preventive measures were universally
               applied, and chemotherapy with a curative intent was initiated
               as per protocol. Three patients were detected to have Covid-19
               infection before admission and one after the institution of
               chemotherapy. Nine patients died after the first cycle of
               chemotherapy, 2 due to severe Covid-19-related illness and 7 due
               to complications of chemotherapy or disease progression.
               Conclusions: . In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, treatment
               for haematological malignancies must continue while balancing
               the risk of Covid-19 infections. Our report emphasizes the

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: A more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, the
               variant of concern 202012/01 or lineage B.1.1.7, has emerged in
               the UK. We aimed to estimate the risk of critical care
               admission, mortality in patients who are critically ill, and
               overall mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with
               non-B.1.1.7. We also compared clinical outcomes between these
               two groups. METHODS: For this observational cohort study, we
               linked large primary care (QResearch), national critical care
               (Intensive Care National Audit \& Research Centre Case Mix
               Programme), and national COVID-19 testing (Public Health
               England) databases. We used SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with
               S-gene molecular diagnostic assay failure (SGTF) as a proxy for
               the presence of lineage B.1.1.7. We extracted two cohorts from
               the data: the primary care cohort, comprising patients in
               primary care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported
               between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 26, 2021, and known SGTF status;
               and the critical care cohort, comprising patients admitted for
               critical care with a positive community COVID-19 test reported
               between Nov 1, 2020, and Jan 27, 2021, and known SGTF status. We
               explored the associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection with and
               without lineage B.1.1.7 and admission to a critical care unit
               (CCU), 28-day mortality, and 28-day mortality following CCU
               admission. We used Royston-Parmar models adjusted for age, sex,
               geographical region, other sociodemographic factors (deprivation
               index, ethnicity, household housing category, and smoking status
               for the primary care cohort; and ethnicity, body-mass index,
               deprivation index, and dependency before admission to acute
               hospital for the CCU cohort), and comorbidities (asthma, chronic
               obstructive pulmonary disease, type 1 and 2 diabetes, and
               hypertension for the primary care cohort; and cardiovascular
               disease, respiratory disease, metastatic disease, and
               immunocompromised conditions for the CCU cohort). We reported
               information on types and duration of organ support for the
               B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 groups. FINDINGS: The primary care
               cohort included 198 420 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of
               these, 117 926 (59·4\%) had lineage B.1.1.7, 836 (0·4\%) were
               admitted to CCU, and 899 (0·4\%) died within 28 days. The
               critical care cohort included 4272 patients admitted to CCU. Of
               these, 2685 (62·8\%) had lineage B.1.1.7 and 662 (15·5\%) died
               at the end of critical care. In the primary care cohort, we
               estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 2·15 (95\% CI
               1·75-2·65) for CCU admission and 1·65 (1·36-2·01) for 28-day
               mortality for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with the
               non-B.1.1.7 group. The adjusted HR for mortality in critical
               care, estimated with the critical care cohort, was 0·91
               (0·76-1·09) for patients with lineage B.1.1.7 compared with
               those with non-B.1.1.7 infection. INTERPRETATION: Patients with
               lineage B.1.1.7 were at increased risk of CCU admission and
               28-day mortality compared with patients with non-B.1.1.7
               SARS-CoV-2. For patients receiving critical care, mortality
               appeared to be independent of virus strain. Our findings
               emphasise the importance of measures to control exposure to and
               infection with COVID-19. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, National

  title     = "High flow nasal cannula for adult acute hypoxemic respiratory
               failure in the {ED} setting",
  author    = "Long, Brit and Liang, Stephen Y and Lentz, Skyler",
  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a noninvasive
               ventilation (NIV) system that has demonstrated promise in the
               emergency department (ED) setting. OBJECTIVE: This narrative
               review evaluates the utility of HFNC in adult patients with
               acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the ED setting.
               DISCUSSION: HFNC provides warm (37 °C), humidified (100\%
               relative humidity) oxygen at high flows with a reliable fraction
               of inspired oxygen (FiO2). HFNC can improve oxygenation, reduce
               airway resistance, provide humidified flow that can flush
               anatomical dead space, and provide a low amount of positive end
               expiratory pressure. Recent literature has demonstrated efficacy
               in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, including pneumonia,
               acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coronavirus disease
               2019 (COVID-19), interstitial lung disease, immunocompromised
               states, the peri-intubation state, and palliative care, with
               reduced need for intubation, length of stay, and mortality in
               some of these conditions. Individual patient factors play an
               important role in infection control risks with respect to the
               use of HFNC in patients with COVID-19. Appropriate personal
               protective equipment, adherence to hand hygiene, surgical mask
               placement over the HFNC device, and environmental controls
               promoting adequate room ventilation are the foundation for
               protecting healthcare personnel. Frequent reassessment of the
               patient placed on HFNC is necessary; those with severe end organ
               dysfunction, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, significantly
               increased respiratory rate, poor oxygenation despite HFNC, and
               tachycardia are at increased risk of HFNC failure and need for
               further intervention. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC demonstrates promise in
               several conditions requiring respiratory support. Further
               randomized trials are needed in the ED setting.",

               patients are at higher risk of COVID-19 to help inform the
               management of patients receiving immunosuppressant therapies
               during the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a random-effects
               meta-analysis of data from studies that reported on the
               prevalence of immunosuppression among patient cohorts with
               COVID-19. RESULTS: Sixty full-text publications were identified.
               In total, six individual studies were included in the final
               analysis, contributing a total of 10 049 patients with COVID-19
               disease. The prevalence of immunosuppressed patients among the
               study cohorts with COVID-19 ranged from 0.126\% to 1.357\%. In
               the pooled cohort a total of 64/10 049 (0.637\%) patients with
               COVID-19 disease was immunosuppressed. Observed to expected
               ratios were used to compare the prevalence of immunosuppression
               in cohorts with confirmed COVID-19 disease to the background
               prevalence of immunosuppression in the general community. The
               observed to expected ratio of immunosuppression among patients

              individuals. Recent reports have raised the alarm for invasive
              ROCM associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection
              causes immune cell dysregulation, cytokine dysregulation, and is
              associated with invasive fungal infections. Immunosuppressive
              treatment of COVID-19 with corticosteroids increases the risk of
              opportunistic infection. We present a series of 3 cases of
              invasive ROCM with different outcomes in immunocompetent
              nondiabetic patients who all received corticosteroids at doses
              higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization,
              and who received oxygen during their SARS-CoV-2 treatment course.
              Immune dysregulatory effects of COVID-19 and high-dose
              corticosteroids may both have caused predisposition to ROCM in
              these cases. Additionally, health system stress caused by
              responding to COVID-19 surges may have predisposed patients to
              exposure to mucormycosis-causing fungi through use of
              non-sterilized water for oxygen humidification. In light of these
              cases, we encourage guideline-based corticosteroid dosing in the

               domestic animals and wildlife, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic.
               Zoonoses are the commonest source of emerging human infections
               and inter-species transmission is facilitated by anthropogenic
               factors such as encroachment and destruction of wilderness
               areas, wildlife trafficking and climate change. South Africa was
               selected for a 'One Health' study to identify research
               priorities for control of zoonoses due to its complex disease
               burden and an overstretched health system. METHODS: A
               multidisciplinary group of 18 experts identified priority
               zoonotic diseases, knowledge gaps and proposed research
               priorities for the next 5 y. Each priority was scored using
               predefined criteria by another group of five experts and then
               weighted by a reference group (n=28) and the 18 experts.
               RESULTS: Seventeen diseases were mentioned with the top five
               being rabies (14/18), TB (13/18), brucellosis (11/18), Rift
               Valley fever (9/11) and cysticercosis (6/18). In total, 97
               specific research priorities were listed, with the majority on
               basic epidemiological research (n=57), such as measuring the
               burden of various zoonoses (n=24), followed by 20 on development
               of new interventions. The highest research priority score was
               for improving existing interventions (0.77/1.0), followed by
               health policy and systems research (0.72/1.0). CONCLUSION:
               Future zoonotic research should improve understanding of
               zoonotic burden and risk factors and new interventions in public
               health. People with limited rural services, immunocompromised,

               SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins are well described in healthy
               convalescent donors, adaptive humoral and cellular immunity has
               not yet been characterized in patients with antibody deficiency
               (Grifoni et al. Cell. 181:1489-1501 e1415, 2020; Burbelo et al.
               2020; Long et al. Nat Med. 26:845-8, 2020; Braun et al. 2020).
               Herein, we describe the clinical course, antibody, and T cell
               responses to SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins in a cohort of adult
               and pediatric patients with antibody deficiencies (n = 5) and
               controls (related and unrelated) infected with SARS-CoV-2. Five
               patients within the same family (3 with antibody deficiency, 2
               immunocompetent controls) showed antibody responses to
               nucleocapsid and spike proteins, as well as SARS-CoV-2 specific
               T cell immunity at days 65-84 from onset of symptoms. No
               significant difference was identified between immunocompromised
               patients and controls. Two additional unrelated, adult patients
               with common variable immune deficiency were assessed. One did
               not show antibody response, but both demonstrated
               SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity when evaluated 33 and 76

               non-HIV patients with COVID-19 who also developed PJP at a
               University Hospital. RESULTS: With the exception of one subject,
               who experienced an atypical and prolonged course of COVID-19,
               all the patients developed PJP after the clinical resolution of
               COVID-19 pneumonia. All but one patient had no pre-existing
               immunosuppressive conditions or other risk factors for PJP
               development at COVID-19 diagnosis. Nonetheless, following the
               course of COVID-19 infection, all the patients fulfilled at
               least one host factor for PJP; indeed, all the patients had
               received at least 2 weeks of high-dose steroids and three out of

               in immunocompetent patients. PJP primary chemoprophylaxis can be
               considered in selected high-risk COVID-19 patients, but further

               CAR-T therapy gives hope to heavily pretreated patients, the
               rapid commercialization and cumulative immunosuppression of this
               therapy predispose patients to infections for a prolonged
               period. CAR-T therapy poses distinctive short- and long-term
               toxicities and infection risks among patients who receive CAR
               T-cells after multiple prior treatments, often including
               hematopoietic cell transplantation. The acute toxicities include
               cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated
               neurotoxicity syndrome. The long-term B cell depletion,
               hypogammaglobulinemia, and cytopenia further predispose patients
               to severe infections and abrogate the remission success achieved
               by the living drug. These on-target-off-tumor toxicities deplete
               B-cells across the entire lineage and further diminish immune
               responses to vaccines. Early observational data suggest that
               patients with hematologic malignancies may not mount adequate
               humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this

               (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent
               plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants. The
               vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized
               for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are
               not yet documented, and populations with immunocompromised
               conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient
               patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response.
               In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to
               SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for
               escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody
               therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen

               antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse
               effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK
               cells in treating COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited.
               Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of
               CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its various mutants.
               CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309
               (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
               neutralizing antibody (NAbs) that targets the highly conserved
               region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and is therefore
               more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2
               isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped
               SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G, N501Y, and E484K mutants.
               Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target
               cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior
               killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of
               the recently reported CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results
               pave the way for generating 'off-the-shelf' S309-CAR-NK cells

               with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has different opinions.
               Some scholars speculated that patients with HIV may be at
               decreased risk for complications of COVID-19 because HIV
               antiretroviral medications may have activity against
               coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2. But others have the opposite
               because of the immunosuppression for HIV patients. Here we
               reported a case of HIV-infected patient confirmed with COVID-19
               and had a favourable prognosis. The patient was a 24-year-old

               followed a regular antiretroviral therapy (ART). After infected

              disease 2019 (COVID-19) in solid organ transplant (SOT)
              recipients remain understudied. METHODS: We used a multicenter
              federated research network to compare clinical outcomes of
              COVID-19 in patients with SOT to a propensity--matched cohort of
              patients without SOT. RESULTS: We identified 2307 SOT recipients
              and 231 047 nontransplant patients with COVID-19. Transplant
              patients were more likely to be male individuals, older, have a
              body mass index >30 kg/m2, and have comorbid hypertension,
              diabetes, nicotine dependence, heart failure, and ischemic heart
              disease compared with the nontransplant group (P < 0.05).
              One-to-one matching was performed for diabetes, hypertension,
              chronic lung diseases, race, nicotine dependence, heart failure,
              ischemic heart disease, and gender. There was no difference in
              the composite outcome of intubation or mechanical ventilation at
              30 days (risk ratio [RR], 1.04; 95\% confidence interval [CI],
              0.86-1.26) or 60 days (RR, 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.86-1.24) between the
              2 groups. Hospitalization rate was higher in the transplant
              cohort (30.97\% versus 25.47\%; RR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.11-1.34).
              There was no difference in mortality at 30 days (6.45\% versus
              5.29\%; RR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 0.88-1.68) or 60 days postdiagnosis
              (RR, 1.05; 95\% CI, 0.83-1.32). More patients in the SOT group
              developed acute renal injury compared with non-SOT cohort
              (24.73\% versus 14.29\%; RR, 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.53-1.96).
              CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SOT have high COVID-19-related
              mortality; however, propensity-matched analyses reveal that this
              increased risk is secondary to higher burden of comorbidities.

               potential increased risks of surgical intervention, anaesthesia

               implemented to adapt referral pathways and mitigate the risk
               posed by COVID-19 during the height of the pandemic, within a
               large Burns Centre. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was
               designed to assess patients treated at the Burns Centre during
               the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020), following
               implementation of new safety measures. All patients were
               analysed for 30-day mortality. In addition, a prospective
               controlled cohort study was undertaken on all inpatients and a
               random sample of outpatients with telephone follow-up at 30
               days. These patients were divided into three groups (operative
               inpatients, non-operative inpatients, outpatients). COVID-19
               related data collected included test results, contact with
               proven cases, isolation status and symptoms. The implemented
               departmental service COVID-19 safety adaptations are described.
               RESULTS: Of 323 patients treated at the Burns Centre during the
               study period, no 30-day COVID-19 related deaths occurred
               (0/323). Of the 80 patients analysed in the prospective
               controlled cohort section of the study, 51 underwent COVID-19
               testing, 3.9\% (2/51) were positive. Both cases were in the
               operative group, however in comparison to the non-operative and
               outpatient groups, there was no significant increase in COVID-19
               incidence in operative patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found no
               COVID-19 related mortality during the study period. With
               appropriate precautions, burns patients were not exposed to an
               increased COVID-19 risk. Similarly, burns patients undergoing
               operative management were not at a significantly increased risk
               of contracting COVID-19 in comparison to non-operative groups.",

               SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be diminished in some patients with

               document provides guidance to all healthcare professionals
               regarding the implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination scheme in
               patients with HF. COVID-19 vaccination is indicated in all
               patients with HF, including those who are immunocompromised
               (e.g. after heart transplantation receiving immunosuppressive
               therapy) and with frailty syndrome. It is preferable to
               vaccinate against COVID-19 patients with HF in an optimal
               clinical state, which would include clinical stability, adequate
               hydration and nutrition, optimized treatment of HF and other
               comorbidities (including iron deficiency), but corrective
               measures should not be allowed to delay vaccination. Patients
               with HF who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 need to
               continue precautionary measures, including the use of facemasks,
               hand hygiene and social distancing. Knowledge on strategies
               preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (including the COVID-19
               vaccination) should be included in the comprehensive educational
               programmes delivered to patients with HF.",

               immunocompromised. While children are generally thought to be at
               less risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults,
               comprehensive population-based evidence for the risk in children
               with cancer is unavailable. We aimed to produce evidence of the
               incidence and outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 in children with cancer
               attending all hospitals treating this population across the UK.
               METHODS: Retrospective and prospective observational study of
               all children in the UK under 16 diagnosed with cancer through
               data collection from all hospitals providing cancer care to this
               population. Eligible patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on
               reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The
               primary end-point was death, discharge or end of active care for
               COVID-19 for those remaining in hospital. RESULTS: Between 12
               March 2020 and 31 July 2020, 54 cases were identified: 15 (28\%)
               were asymptomatic, 34 (63\%) had mild infections and 5 (10\%)
               moderate, severe or critical infections. No patients died and
               only three patients required intensive care support due to
               COVID-19. Estimated incidence of hospital identified SARS-CoV-2
               infection in children with cancer under 16 was 3\%. CONCLUSIONS:
               Children with cancer with SARS-CoV-2 infection do not appear at
               increased risk of severe infection compared to the general
               paediatric population. This is reassuring and supports the
               continued delivery of standard treatment.",

               resulting from the underlying disease and oncological treatment
               that significantly impair cellular and humoral immunity. Here we
               report on a beneficial impact of a passive immunotherapy with
               convalescent plasma to treat a prolonged, active COVID-19
               infection in a patient with a history of nasopharyngeal diffuse
               large B-cell lymphoma treated with the therapy inducing
               substantial impairment of particularly humoral arm of immune
               system. The specific aim was to quantify SARS-CoV2 neutralizing
               antibodies in a patient plasma during the course of therapy.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: Besides the standard of care treatment
               and monitoring, neutralizing antibody titers in patient's serum
               samples, calibrated according to the First WHO International
               Standard for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (human), were
               quantified in a time-dependent manner. During the immunotherapy
               period peripheral blood flow cytometry immunophenotyping was
               conducted to characterize lymphocyte subpopulations. RESULTS:
               The waves of clinical improvements and worsening coincided with
               transfused neutralizing antibodies rises and drops in the
               patient's systemic circulation, proving their contribution in
               controlling the disease progress. Besides the patient's lack of
               own humoral immune system, immunophenotyping analysis revealed
               also the reduced level of helper T-lymphocytes and immune
               exhaustion of monocytes. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic approach based
               on convalescent plasma transfusion transformed a prolonged,
               active COVID-19 infection into a manageable chronic disease.",

               experience of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transplant
               patients in one of the most affected parts of the UK with direct
               comparison to waitlisted patients. METHODS: A single-center
               prospective study of symptomatic severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive waitlisted and
               transplant patients was undertaken to compare these groups and
               assess clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 60 consecutive
               symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were identified with 32
               active waitlisted patients and 28 functioning renal transplants.
               Demographics were similar. The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19
               in the waitlisted group was 9.9\% compared to 1.9\% in renal
               transplant patients (P < 0.001). Immunosuppression did not
               influence initial symptomology. Fifteen percent of patients in
               the waitlisted and 32\% in the transplant groups died (P =
               0.726). Mortality as proportion of total waitlisted (321
               patients) and transplant population (1434 patients) of our
               centre was 1.5\% and 0.6\% (P < 0.001), respectively. C-reactive
               protein (CRP) at 48 h and peak CRP were associated with
               mortality in both groups while quick sequential organ failure
               assessment score at 48 h (P = 0.036) was associated with
               mortality for transplant patients. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of
               COVID-19 is higher in the waitlisted population but transplant
               patients have more severe disease, reflected by higher
               mortality. CRP at 48 h can be used as a predictive tool. In the
               absence of effective treatments, the current strategy of
               shielding is arguably the most important factor in protecting

               reports inform of increased mortality among this population.
               METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory
               parameters, outcomes, and management once discharged of CKD-5D
               patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from our health area. RESULTS:
               Out of the 429 CKD-5D population, 36 were diagnosed with
               SARS-CoV-2 infection (8\%): 34 on in-center hemodialysis and 2
               on peritoneal dialysis. Five were asymptomatic. The most common
               symptom was fever (70\%), followed by dyspnea and cough. History
               of cardiovascular disease and elevation of LDH and C-reactive
               protein during admission were associated with higher mortality.
               Thirteen patients died (36\%), 8 patients were admitted to an
               ICU, and survival was low (38\%) among the latter. The mean time
               to death was 12 days. Most discharged patients got negative
               rRT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs within 26 days of diagnosis.
               However, there is a portion of cured patients that continue to
               have positive results even more than 2 months after the initial
               presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on dialysis have an
               increased mortality risk if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Preventive
               measures have proven useful. Thus, proper ones, such as
               universal screening of the population and isolation when
               required, need to be generalized. Better de-isolation criteria

  abstract = "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There likely are several predisposing factors
              to secondary infections in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19), some of which may be preventable. The aim of this
              review is to explore the literature, summarize potential
              predisposing factors to secondary infections and their incidence.
              It also summarizes a variety of healthcare scenarios in which
              different kinds of secondary infections occur. RECENT FINDINGS:
              Apart from immune dysregulation, severe resource limitations in
              healthcare settings have made COVID-19 units conducive to a
              variety of secondary infections. Long-term effect of excess
              antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients is yet to be studied. Very
              few studies have assessed secondary infections as the primary
              outcome measure making it difficult to know the true incidence.
              Mortality attributable to secondary infections in COVID-19
              patients is also unclear. SUMMARY: Incidence of secondary
              infections in COVID-19 patients is likely higher than what is
              reported in the literature. Well designed studies are needed to
              understand the incidence and impact of secondary infections in
              this patient population. Many of these may be preventable
              especially now, as personal protective equipment and other
              healthcare resources are recovering. Infection prevention and
              control (IPC) and antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) must
              reassess current situation to correct any breaches that could
              potentially cause more harm in these already vulnerable patients
              as we brace for a future surge with another pandemic wave.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The clinical course of COVID-19 may vary
              significantly. The presence of comorbidities prolongs the
              recovery time. The recovery in patients with mild-to-moderate
              symptoms might take 10 days, while in those with a critical
              illness or immunocompromised status could take 15 days.
              Considering the lack of data about predictors that could affect
              the recovery time, we conducted this study to identify them.
              METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented in the
              COVID-19 clinic of a teaching and referral university hospital in
              Tehran. Patients with the highly suggestive symptoms who had
              computed tomography (CT) imaging results with typical findings of
              COVID-19 or positive results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase
              chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled in the study. Inpatient and
              outpatient COVID-19 participants were followed up by regular
              visits or phone calls, and the recovery period was recorded.
              RESULTS: A total of 478 patients were enrolled. The mean age of
              patients was 54.11 $\pm$ 5.65 years, and 44.2\% were female. The
              median time to recovery was 13.5 days (IQR: 9). Although in the
              bivariate analysis, multiple factors, including hypertension,
              fever, diabetes mellitus, gender, and admission location,
              significantly contributed to prolonging the recovery period, in
              multivariate analysis, only dyspnea had a significant association
              with this variable (p = 0.02, the adjusted OR of 2.05; 95\% CI
              1.12-3.75). CONCLUSION: This study supports that dyspnea is a
              predictor of recovery time. It seems like optimal management of
              the comorbidities plays the most crucial role in recovery from
              COVID-19.",

               expert centers for neuromyelitis optica and related disorders.
               Patients with NMOSD or MOGAD included in the study received a
               confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1
               March 2020 and 30 June 2020. Main outcome was COVID-19 severity
               score assessed on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from 1
               (not hospitalized with no limitations on activities) to 7
               (death). RESULTS: Fifteen cases (mean [SD] age: 39.3 [14.3]
               years, 11 female) were included. Five patients (33.3\%) were
               hospitalized, all receiving rituximab. A 24-year-old patient
               with positive aquaporine-4 antibody, with obesity as
               comorbidity, needed mechanical ventilation. Outpatients were
               receiving anti-CD20 (5), mycophenolate mofetil (3) or
               azathioprine (3). They were younger (mean [SD] age: 37.0 [13.4]
               years), with a longer disease duration (mean [SD]: 8.3 [6.3]
               years) and had a lower expanded disability severity score (EDSS)
               score (median [range] EDSS: 2.5 [0-4]) relative to patients

              vaccination against COVID-19 in the territory covered by the
              Agency for Health Protection of the Metropolitan Area of Milan
              from 01.01.2021 to 30.09.2021. DESIGN: descriptive study of
              vaccine adherence; predictive study of the factors associated
              with vaccine adherence, efficacy of vaccination in terms of
              hospitalization and mortality, and factors that increase the risk
              of hospital admission following full vaccination. SETTING AND
              PARTICIPANTS: population-based study with subjects aged >18 years
              eligible for vaccination (N. 2,981,997). An information system
              obtained by integrating various administrative healthcare sources
              made it possible to analyse socioeconomic characteristics,
              COVID-19 related hospitalizations, and general mortality in
              subjects eligible for vaccination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: full
              vaccination (2 doses); COVID-19-related hospitalizations,
              COVID-19-related hospitalizations occurring more than 15 days
              after the second dose, general mortality. RESULTS: in the first
              nine months of the vaccination campaign, 74.7\% of the subjects
              (N. 2,228,915) was fully vaccinated, whereas 15.6\% (N. 465,829)
              did not even receive one dose. Women have a lower probability of
              getting vaccinated than men; the 50-59 years and 70+ years age
              groups emerge as the most problematic to reach, while the younger
              one (<40) is the most adherent. A social gradient emerged, with
              residents of more disadvantaged areas progressively less incline
              to get vaccinated than those living in more affluent areas.
              Adherence is greater in Italian citizenship and is likely to
              increase with an increase in the number of chronic conditions.
              Hospitalizations amounted to 1.22\% (N. 5,672) in the
              unvaccinated population compared to 0.05\% (N. 1,013) in the
              vaccinated population; general mortality was 4.51\% (N. 15,198)
              in the unvaccinated population against 0.32\% (N. 8.733) in the
              vaccinated population. Sociodemographic factors and the presence
              of previous health conditions are important predictors of
              hospitalization outcomes even within the fully vaccinated
              population. Specifically, the highest hazard ratios are found in
              subjects with heart failure (HR 2.15; 95\%CI 1.83-2.53), in
              immunocompromised patients (HR 2.02; 95\%CI 1.52-2.69), and in
              transplant recipients (HR 1.92; 95\%CI 1.10-3.33). CONCLUSIONS:
              vaccination campaign adherence is affected by the
              sociodemographic characteristics of the population and is a
              determining factor in preventing hospitalizations for COVID-19
              and death. The persistent higher risk of hospitalization in
              chronic subjects following the second dose emphasizes the need to
              direct booster doses to the more vulnerable. Information systems

               ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines) in 140 participants receiving
               immunosuppression for autoimmune rheumatic and glomerular
               diseases.ResultsFollowing first-dose vaccine, 28.6\% (34/119) of
               infection-na{\"\i}ve participants seroconverted and 26.0\%
               (13/50) had detectable T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. Immune
               responses were augmented by second-dose vaccine, increasing
               seroconversion and T-cell response rates to 59.3\% (54/91) and
               82.6\% (38/46), respectively. B-cell depletion at the time of
               vaccination was associated with failure to seroconvert, and
               tacrolimus therapy was associated with diminished T-cell
               responses. Reassuringly, only 8.7\% of infection-na{\"\i}ve
               patients had neither antibody nor T-cell responses detected

               serological responses, but T-cell responses are preserved in
               this group. We suggest that repeat vaccine doses for serological

               experiences with adult transplant recipients have been
               published, literature centered on the pediatric population is
               limited. We herein report a multi-center, multi-organ cohort
               analysis of COVID-19-positive transplant recipients $\leq$ 18
               years at time of transplant. Data were collected via
               institutions' respective electronic medical record systems.
               Local review boards approved this cross-institutional study.
               Among 5 transplant centers, 26 patients (62\% male) were
               reviewed with a median age of 8 years. Six were heart
               recipients, 8 kidney, 10 liver, and 2 lung. Presenting symptoms
               included cough (n = 12 (46\%)), fever (n = 9 (35\%)), dry/sore
               throat (n = 3 (12\%)), rhinorrhea (n = 3 (12\%)), anosmia (n = 2
               (8\%)), chest pain (n = 2 (8\%)), diarrhea (n = 2 (8\%)),
               dyspnea (n = 1 (4\%)), and headache (n = 1 (4\%)). Six patients
               (23\%) were asymptomatic. No patient required supplemental
               oxygen, intubation, or ECMO. Eight patients (31\%) were
               hospitalized at time of diagnosis, 3 of whom were already
               admitted for unrelated problems. Post-transplant
               immunosuppression was reduced for only 2 patients (8\%). All
               symptomatic patients recovered within 7 days. Our
               multi-institutional experience suggests the prognoses of
               pediatric transplant recipients infected with COVID-19 may
               mirror those of immunocompetent children, with infrequent

               2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on cancer care are multiple, entailing a
               high risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in
               patients with cancer treated by chemotherapy. SARS-CoV-2
               vaccines represent an opportunity to decrease the rate of severe
               COVID-19 cases in patients with cancer and also to restore
               normal cancer care. Patients with cancer to be targeted for
               vaccination are difficult to define owing to the limited
               contribution of these patients in the phase III trials testing
               the different vaccines. It seems appropriate to vaccinate not
               only patients with cancer with ongoing treatment or with a
               treatment having been completed less than 3 years ago but also
               household and close contacts. High-risk patients with cancer who
               are candidates for priority access to vaccination are those
               treated by chemotherapy. The very high-priority population
               includes patients with curative treatment and palliative first-
               or second-line chemotherapy, as well as patients requiring
               surgery or radiotherapy involving a large volume of lung, lymph
               node and/or haematopoietic tissue. When possible, vaccination
               should be carried out before cancer treatment begins. SARS-CoV-2
               vaccination can be performed during chemotherapy while avoiding
               periods of neutropenia and lymphopenia. For organisational
               reasons, vaccination should be performed in cancer care centres
               with messenger RNA vaccines (or non-replicating adenoviral
               vaccines in non-immunocompromised patients). Considering the
               current state of knowledge, the benefit-risk ratio strongly
               favours SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of all patients with cancer. To
               obtain more data concerning the safety and effectiveness of
               vaccines, it is necessary to implement cohorts of vaccinated
               patients with cancer.",

               immunity (SARS-CoV-2-CMI) in kidney transplant (KT) recipients
               remain largely unknown. METHODS: We enumerated
               SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-$\gamma$-producing CD69+ CD4+ and
               CD8+ T cells at months 4 and 6 from the diagnosis of coronavirus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 21 KT recipients by intracellular
               cytokine staining. Overlapping peptides encompassing the
               SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein N-terminal 1- to 643-amino
               acid sequence and the membrane protein were used as stimulus.
               SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the S1 protein were assessed
               by ELISA at month 6. RESULTS: Detectable ($\geq$0.1\%)
               SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T-cell response was found in 57.1\% and
               47.4\% of patients at months 4 and 6. Corresponding rates for
               CD8+ T cells were 19.0\% and 42.1\%, respectively. Absolute
               SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell counts increased from month 4 to
               month 6 in CD8+ (P = 0.086) but not CD4+ subsets (P = 0.349).
               Four of 10 patients with any detectable response at month 4 had
               lost SARS-CoV-2-CMI by month 6, whereas 5 of 9 patients mounted
               SARS-CoV-2-CMI within this period. All but 2 patients (89.5\%)
               tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Patients lacking detectable
               SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ response by month 6 were more likely to
               be under tacrolimus (100.0\% versus 66.7\%; P = 0.087) and to
               have received tocilizumab for the previous COVID-19 episode
               (40.0\% versus 0.0\%; P = 0.087). CONCLUSIONS: Although still
               exploratory and limited by small sample size, the present study
               suggests that a substantial proportion of KT recipients
               exhibited detectable SARS-CoV-2-CMI after 6 months from COVID-19

               benefit from steroid therapy. We believe the condition described
               here is underdiagnosed and undertreated by doctors worldwide.
               Because of the ongoing global pandemic we are now encountering a
               new kind of patient, patients that have recovered from COVID-19.

               about this growing patient population.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The recent availability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has
              raised concerns in certain patient groups, such as those with
              multiple sclerosis. However, there are currently few publications
              that provide information on this issue. We pooled the information
              available on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against
              SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, with and without
              disease-modifying therapy. DEVELOPMENT: The study consisted in a
              literature search focused on the types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,
              the current status of their approval, and the data available on
              the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with multiple
              sclerosis, including the new COVID-19 vaccines. Based on this
              search, the document has been designed taking into account
              current evidence and expert recommendations. There are no data on
              the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with
              multiple sclerosis. However, evidence does exist to suggest that
              messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are as safe in
              these patients as in other individuals. Some therapies with
              immunosuppressants might reduce the effectiveness of these
              vaccines and require the scheduling of their administration,
              preferably before the start of treatment if possible. CONCLUSION:
              The data available make it possible to recommend mRNA vaccines
              against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple sclerosis. In
              patients on fingolimod, cladribine, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab and
              rituximab, vaccination prior to the initiation of medication
              administration would be recommendable whenever possible.",

               testing. The 61 patients who were included in the final analysis

               (Interquartile range 55.0-75.0) from symptom onset. Note that,
               51 of 61 patients (83.6\%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG results,
               whereas 10 (16.4\%) had negative IgG results. Six (60\%) out of

               recipients: Where should we begin?",

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: Chronic immunosuppression is associated with an
               increased risk of opportunistic infections. Although kidney
               transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
               have higher mortality than the general population, data on their
               risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are unknown. Subject of Review: A
               recent single-center screening study from the UK
               (Transplantation. 2021 Jan 1;105(1):151-7) showed that 89
               (10.4\%) of 855 consecutive kidney transplant recipients tested
               positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Risk factors for infection
               included a nonwhite background, diabetes, and a history of
               allograft rejection. Risk factors for mortality in individuals
               who developed COVID-19 were older age and receiving steroids.
               Second Opinion: This study shows that the rate of SARS-CoV-2
               infection in kidney transplant recipients is similar to the one
               observed in the general population in the same area (13\%),
               indicating that transplant recipients are not at increased risk
               of COVID-19. However, the investigators raise the interesting
               point that since transplant individuals were advised to shelter
               earlier than the general population, they may be in fact more
               susceptible. This statement is hard to substantiate, but the
               identification of specific risk factors for infection and poor
               outcomes is crucial to tailor strategies to prevent spread of
               the infection. This is particularly important, considering that
               kidney transplant recipients may be at increased risk of
               prolonged viral spread and in-host viral mutations, making them
               not just a particularly fragile population for COVID-19 but also
               a potentially major source of further contagions.",

               COVID-19 compared to non-IS patients. METHODS: We designed a
               retrospective cohort study. We included all patients
               hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the
               SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a large multicentre national cohort in

               and 394 (3.0\%) were receiving systemic steroids, biological
               treatments, and immunosuppressors, respectively. Compared to
               non-IS patients, the aOR (95\% CI) for in-hospital death was
               1.60 (1.43-1.79) for all IS patients, 1.39 (1.18-1.63) for
               patients with SO cancer, 2.31 (1.76-3.03) for patients with
               haematological cancer and 3.12 (2.23-4.36) for patients with SO

               receiving systemic steroids, biological treatments and
               immunosuppressors compared to non-IS patients were 2.16

               experience of transitioning patients from clinic-based to home
               based IVIG and/or SCIG infusions to decrease the risk of
               COVID-19 exposure. METHODS: Criteria were developed to identify
               high-risk immunosuppressed patients who would be appropriate
               candidates for potential conversion to home based IVIG
               infusions. Data were collected via chart review, and cost
               analysis was performed using Medicare Part B reimbursement data.
               A patient outcome questionnaire was developed for administration
               through follow-up phone calls. RESULTS: From March to May 2020,
               45 patients met criteria for home-based infusion, with 27
               patients (60\%) agreeing to home-based infusion. Posttransition
               patient outcomes assessment, conducted in 26 patients (96\%),
               demonstrated good patient understanding of the home-based
               infusion process. No infusion-related complications were
               reported, and 24 patients (92\%) had no concerns about receiving
               future IVIG and/or SCIG doses at home. No patient tested
               positive for COVID-19 during the study period. Clinic infusion
               visits decreased by 26.6 visits per month, resulting in a total
               of 106 hours of additional available infusion chair time per
               month and associated cost savings of \$12,877. CONCLUSION:
               Transition of clinic based to home based IVIG/SCIG infusion can
               be successfully done to decrease potential exposure during a
               pandemic in a high-risk immunosuppressed population, with no
               impact on patient satisfaction, adherence, or efficacy. The
               home-based infusion initiative was associated with a reduction
               in costs to patients and an increase in available chair time in
               the infusion clinic.",

               features of coronavirus disease 2019 in a prospective cohort of
               114 immunosuppressed children and adolescents from three groups:
               kidney transplantation, liver transplantation, and cancer
               patients. Among the thirty-five (30.7\%) patients who had a
               positive serological test for SARS-CoV-2, 77\% did not report
               previous symptoms and none of them developed any complications
               of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after 30 or more days of

               courses and further addresses the immunological aspects. CASE
               PRESENTATIONS: Oropharyngeal swaps were collected continuously
               during hospitalization for two immunocompromised patients
               infected with SARS-CoV-2 and sent for analysis to real time
               reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral
               culture assessed by plaque assay and full genome sequencing.
               Blood samples for flow cytometry and further immunological
               analysis were taken once during admission. One patient was
               without symptoms of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) whereas
               the other had severe respiratory symptoms requiring a stay at an
               intensive care unit (ICU) and treatment with remdesivir and
               dexamethasone. Despite their difference in clinical courses,
               they both continuously shed SARS-CoV-2 with high viral loads in
               culture. Both patients had undetectable anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG

               vaccines and recommendation of vaccination by Center for Disease
               Control and Prevention (CDC), the immunization rates among
               adults less than 65 years of age with chronic and
               immunocompromised conditions remain low. METHODS: This
               interventional (cohort) study aimed to improve the pneumococcal
               vaccination rate for patients with an increased risk of
               pneumococcal disease by utilizing a three-pronged approach. This
               included: (1) clinician education webinar, (2) pre-visit
               counseling performed by registered nurses, targeted toward
               patients with upcoming appointments, to address vaccination
               status, and (3) modified pre-visit interdisciplinary team huddle
               with clinicians and registered nurses to review which patients
               are amenable to vaccination at the time of visit and those who
               may benefit from re-engagement and further motivational
               interviewing. After the completion of the 10-week intervention,
               study organizers reviewed the percent of patients with completed
               pneumococcal vaccinations. RESULTS: In this 10-week rapid cycle
               initiative, a total of 482 patients were eligible for
               vaccination. During the intervention phase, 370 patients were
               contacted and of these 38\% of patients were amenable to
               receiving a vaccine during the pre-visit counseling, 5\% were
               previously vaccinated, 18\% were not amenable, and 38\% were
               unreachable prior to visit. This initiative resulted in a 43\%
               increase in the vaccination rate in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS:
               The significant increase in vaccination rate supports the
               utilization of a framework in the multidisciplinary approach to
               pre-visit planning in non-primary care specialties and other
               vaccination efforts, especially emerging diseases such as
               COVID-19. Future directions of study include the efficacy of
               telemedicine counseling with a same-day appointment for
               vaccination, co-location of registered nurses within the
               practice sites, as well as the use of other ancillary staff

               greater risk for VAP. With the dynamic changes in the empirical
               world, updated evidence must be used to guide the standard of
               practice. This literature review assimilates the recent evidence
               for VAP prevention. METHOD: The Preferred Reporting Items for
               Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis framework guided the
               selection of the included research articles. Medline, EBSCO
               host, CINAHL, UpToDate and Google Scholar databases explored,
               for relevant publications between 2010 and 2020. The quality of
               evidence for the 14 studies selected were rated using the
               hierarchy of quantitative research designs. RESULTS:
               Evidence-based VAP preventive strategies are prevention of
               aspiration, minimizing ventilator days, reducing the pathogen
               load, safe endotracheal suction practices, and pharmaceutical
               preventive measures. The mandates for VAP preventive measures

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Retropharyngeal abscesses are rarely reported in
               adults and occur mostly in patients with immunocompromised or as
               a foreign body complication. Admittedly, the treatment of
               retropharyngeal abscesses frequently involves surgical drainage
               to achieve the best results. However, when retropharyngeal
               abscesses occurred in a highly suspected patient with COVID-19,
               the managements and treatments should be caution to prevent the
               spread of the virus. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: On February 13, a
               40-year-old male with retropharyngeal abscesses turned to our
               department complaining dyspnea and dysphagia. In addition, his
               chest CT scan shows a suspected COVID-19 infection, thus making
               out Multiple Disciplinary Team determine to perform percutaneous
               drainage and catheterization through left anterior cervical
               approach under the guidance of B-ultrasound. Finally, the
               patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on
               February 27 after 14 days of isolation. There was no recurrence
               after half a year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: By presenting this
               case, we aim at raising awareness of different surgical drainage
               methods and summarizing our experience in the management of
               retropharyngeal abscesses during the outbreak of COVID-19.",

               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have led to changes or
               discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications among patients
               with systemic rheumatic disease. Our goal was to assess
               patients' perspectives regarding medication modifications and
               deviations from planned uses during the height of the pandemic.
               METHODS: Adult patients of 13 rheumatologists at an academic
               center with physician-diagnosed rheumatic disease and prescribed
               disease-modifying medications were interviewed by telephone and
               asked open-ended questions about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on
               their medications. Responses were analyzed using content and
               thematic analyses to generate categories that described patterns
               of medication modification. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients
               (mean age 50 years, 86\% women, 34\% non-White race or Latino
               ethnicity) with diverse diagnoses (30\% lupus, 26\% rheumatoid
               arthritis, 44\% other) who were taking various medications were
               enrolled. Patients reported clinically relevant issues that were
               iteratively reviewed to generate unique categories of medication
               modification: medications and increased or decreased risk of
               SARS-CoV-2 infection; role of hydroxychloroquine; maintaining
               medication status quo; role of glucocorticoids; increasing or
               decreasing existing medications in relation to clinical disease
               activity; postponing infusions; and medication plan if infected
               by SARS-CoV-2. Some modifications were suboptimal for disease
               control but were made to mitigate infection risk and to minimize
               potential harm when patients were unable to obtain laboratory
               tests and physical examinations due to cessation of in-person
               office visits. CONCLUSION: During the height of the pandemic,
               substantial medication modifications were made that, in some
               cases, were temporizing measures and deviations from planned
               regimens. Future studies will assess short- and long-term
               sequelae of these medication modifications.",

               tumors and hematological malignancies. METHOD: This
               retrospective single oncologic center study included adults with
               solid tumors or hematological malignancies referred to testing
               by naso-pharyngeal swab for a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from March 10 to

               1.02-1.08), performance status $\geq$2 (OR: 2.38, 95\% CI:
               1.22-4.70), inpatient status (OR: 2.36, 95\%CI: 1.11-4.91), and
               hematological malignancies (OR: 2.48, 95\% CI: 1.23-4.96). In
               contrast, OR for solid tumors reveals a negative association
               (OR: 0.40, 95\% CI: 0.20-0.81). When integrating severe outcome
               (ICU admission or COVID-19-related death) as a dependent
               variable, the univariate logistic regression model shows
               significant ORs for pre-existing lymphopenia (OR: 4.0, 95\% CI:

               9-month-old girl with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia received
               an HSCT from a haploidentical donor. On day +99, during routine

               number of immunocompromised individuals, empirical use of
               broad-spectrum antimicrobials and widespread use of
               catheterizations are the predisposing factors in the development
               of infection. There are problems for the identification of
               C.auris with the routine methods. In this case report,
               infections with C.auris, isolated for the first time from three
               patients in our hospital's intensive care units (ICU) between
               November 2020-January 2021, were presented. The first case was a
               46-year-old male patient with laryngeal carcinoma who developed
               cardiopulmonary arrest during anesthesia induction in the tumor
               operation, and was followed up in the ICU. C.auris growth was
               detected in the blood and intravenous (IV) catheter tip cultures
               on the 66th day of admittance. Cure achieved on the 24th day
               under caspofungin treatment as no growth was determined. Second
               case was a 71-year-old female patient admitted to the emergency
               department with shortness of breath and general condition
               disorder that developed after COVID-19 infection and
               hospitalized in ICU with the diagnosis of pneumonia and acute
               renal failure. In the 16th day of admittance C.auris growth was
               detected in blood and from catheter tip cultures and the patient
               died in the 18th day. The third case was a 49-year-old male
               patient, followed up in ICU with the diagnosis of subarachnoid
               hemorrhage after he admitted to the emergency department with
               confusion. In the 35th day of admittance, 100000 CFU/ mL C auris
               growth was detected in urine culture. The patient was accepted
               as asymptomatic fungiuria and followed up in the ICU. It was
               determined that the three patients were intubated, had urinary
               and femoral venous catheters and were being followed under wide
               spectrum antibiotherapy when the growth of C.auris was detected.
               Isolates identified as C.auris by MALDI-TOF Microflex LT/SH
               Smart MS in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory were then
               confirmed by conventional methods and DNA sequencing in the
               National Mycology Reference Laboratory. Antifungal
               susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution
               method. Fluconazole MIC values were >256 mg/ml for all cases.
               Long-term survival in hospital environments, colonization on

               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019, the
               virus has spread rapidly across the globe leading to millions of
               infections and subsequent deaths. Although the virus infects
               those exposed indiscriminately, there are groups in society at
               an increased risk of severe infection, leading to increased
               morbidity. Patients suffering from hematological cancers,
               particularly leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, may be one such
               group and previous studies have suggested that they may be at a
               three to four times greater risk of severe COVID-19 after
               SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to admissions to ICU, mechanical
               ventilation, and death compared to those without such
               malignancies. Serological testing for IgG seroconversion has
               been extensively studied in the immunocompetent, but fewer
               publications have characterized this process in large series of
               immunocompromised patients. This study described 20 patients

               an immune response to the infection. Yet despite this low

               Immunocompromised patients could have a more severe coronavirus

               epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 raises concerns
               pertinent to mass vaccination campaigns and use of monoclonal
               antibodies. We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7
               variant of concern (VOC), including virological characteristics
               and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and
               without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study, samples
               positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9,
               2020, for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on
               or before Dec 20, 2020, in London, UK, were sequenced and
               analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted
               Poisson regression models to investigate the association between
               B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease (defined as point 6 or
               higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or
               positive test) and death within 28 days of a positive test and
               did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically
               shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated
               patients. Viral load was compared by proxy, using PCR cycle
               threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496
               patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met
               inclusion criteria, 341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198
               (58\%) of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143 (42\%) had
               non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association
               between severe disease and death and lineage (B.1.1.7 vs
               non-B.1.1.7) in unadjusted analyses (prevalence ratio [PR] 0·97
               [95\% CI 0·72-1·31]), or in analyses adjusted for hospital, sex,
               age, comorbidities, and ethnicity (adjusted PR 1·02
               [0·76-1·38]). We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in
               123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32
               remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in
               B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by
               cycle threshold value (mean 28·8 [SD 4·7] vs 32·0 [4·8];
               p=0·0085) and genomic read depth (1280 [1004] vs 831 [682];
               p=0·0011). INTERPRETATION: Emerging evidence exists of increased
               transmissibility of B.1.1.7, and we found increased virus load
               by proxy for B.1.1.7 in our data. We did not identify an

               about patient diagnosis and follow-up of chronically ill
               patients. Patients suffering from chronic illnesses,
               concomitantly infected by SARS-CoV-2, globally tend to have a
               worse prognosis and poor outcomes. Renal tropism and acute
               kidney injury following SARS-CoV-2 infection has recently been
               described in the literature, with elevated mortality rates.
               Furthermore, patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease,
               infected by SARS-CoV-2, should be monitored carefully. Here, we
               report the case of a 69-year-old patient with splenic marginal
               zone lymphoma, suffering from longstanding chronic kidney
               disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A
               69-year-old male patient previously diagnosed with pulmonary
               embolism and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (Splenomegaly,
               Matutes 2/5, CD5 negative and CD23 positive), was admitted to
               the hospital with shortness of breath, fever and asthenia. A
               nasopharyngeal swab test was performed in addition to a CT-scan,
               which confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blood creatinine increased
               following SARS-CoV-2 infection at 130 $\mu$mol/l, with usual
               values at 95 $\mu$mol/l. The patient was discharged at home with
               rest and symptomatic medical treatment (paracetamol and
               hydration), then readmitted to the hospital in August 2020. A
               kidney biopsy was therefore conducted as blood creatinine levels
               were abnormally elevated. Immunodetection performed in a renal
               biopsy specimen confirmed co-localization of SARS-CoV2
               nucleocapsid and protease 3C proteins with ACE2, Lewis x and
               sialyl-Lewis x antigens in proximal convoluted tubules and
               podocytes. Co-localization of structural and non-structural
               viral proteins clearly demonstrated viral replication in
               proximal convoluted tubules in this chronically ill patient.
               Additionally, we observed the co-localization of sialyl-Lewis x
               and ACE2 receptors in the same proximal convoluted tubules.
               Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction test performed
               on the kidney biopsy was negative, with very low Ct levels
               (above 40). The patient was finally readmitted to the
               haematology department for initiation of chemotherapy, including
               CHOP protocol and Rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: Our case emphasizes on
               the importance of monitoring kidney function in immunosuppressed
               patients and patients suffering from cancer following SARS-CoV-2
               infection, through histological screening. Further studies will
               be required to decipher the mechanisms underlying chronic kidney
               disease and the putative role of sialyl-Lewis x and HBGA during

               OBJECTIVE: To elucidate people with MS' experiences of accessing
               health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. DESIGN: A
               qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews and
               thematic analysis. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Eight adults with
               a clinical diagnosis of MS participated in telephone or video
               call interviews between June and July 2020. RESULTS:
               Participants were aware that having MS made them more vulnerable
               to contracting COVID-19. In some cases, usual care was postponed
               or not sought. Some circumstances warranted the risk of a
               face-to-face consultation. Benefits of telehealth consultations
               included improved access, convenience and being contact-free. In
               comparison with video consultations, those via telephone were
               considered less personal and limited capacity to read body
               language, and for physical examination. Most participants hoped
               to incorporate telehealth into their future health-care
               routines. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Personal risk assessment
               and trust in health-care professionals are determinants of the
               mode through which people with MS accessed health care during
               the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has been a valuable tool to
               mitigate COVID-19 transmission through enabling contact-free
               consultations. People with MS may find specific value in video
               consultations, which enable visualization of physical function.

               Severely immunocompromised patients, whose clearance of the

              are passive immunotherapies consisting in the infusion of plasma

              pre-existing evidence in many other viral diseases, such as SARS,
              MERS and Ebola, CP and HP have also been proposed for the
              treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, due to the lack of large,
              well-designed, clinical trials, no clear-cut guidelines exist
              about what subtype of patient CP and HP should be administered
              to. CASE PRESENTATION: We have reported the cases of 3 patients,
              all immunosuppressed and affected by non-severe, prolonged
              COVID-19. They were treated with HP, whose neutralizing titer was
              higher than 1/80. The first patient was a 55-year-old male, who
              had undergone lung transplant. He was under therapy with
              Tacrolimus and developed non-neutralizing antibodies against
              SARS-CoV2. The second patient was a 77-year-old female, affected
              by follicular lymphoma. She had tested positive for SARS-CoV2
              after 6 months. The third was a 60-year-old patient, affected by
              chronic leukemia. He did not develop antibodies after 2-month
              disease. All 3 patients received HP and had tested negative for
              SARS-CoV2 within 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Despite encouraging initial
              data, no strong evidence exist in support of CP and HP to treat
              COVID-19. In our experience, although limited due to the reduced
              number of patients, we found a good safety and efficacy of HP in
              3 immuno-deficient subjects. Further data are needed in order to
              assess whether this subtype of patients may particularly benefit

               sign with multiple causes. With the recent outbreak of
               coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many cases of ocular

               this condition. We report here the first case of FBA in a human
               immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with coexisting
               cytomegalovirus (CMV) and COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION:
               A 33-year-old Malay man with underlying acquired
               immunodeficiency syndrome receiving highly active antiretroviral
               therapy was referred to the Opthalmology Department with
               complaints of blurry vision for the past 2 months. He had tested
               positive for and been diagnosed with COVID-19 1 month
               previously. Clinical examination of the fundus revealed
               extensive perivascular sheathing of both the artery and vein
               suggestive of FBA in the right eye. Laboratory testing of nasal
               swabs for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum CMV
               antibody were positive. The patient was then admitted to the
               COVID-19 ward and treated with intravenous ganciclovir.
               CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of and take the necessary
               standard precautions for possible coexistence of COVID-19 in an
               immunocompromised patient presenting with blurred vision, eye
               redness, dry eye and foreign body sensation despite the absence
               of clinical features suggestive of COVID-19. Whether FBA is one
               of the ocular signs of co-infection of COVID-19 and CMV remains
               unknown. Further studies are needed to provide more information
               on ocular signs presented in patients with concurrent COVID-19

               blunted in such patients. We aimed to analyse the humoral and
               cellular response to prime-boost vaccination with the BNT162b2
               vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) in cardiothoracic transplant
               recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 50 transplant
               patients [1-3 years post heart (42), lung (7), or heart-lung (1)
               transplant, mean age 55 $\pm$ 10 years] and a control group of
               50 healthy staff members were included. Blood samples were
               analysed 21 days after the prime and the boosting dose,
               respectively, to quantify anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)
               immunoglobulin titres (tested by Abbott, Euroimmun and
               RocheElecsys Immunoassays, each) and the functional inhibitory
               capacity of neutralizing antibodies (Genscript). To test for a
               specific T-cell response, heparinized whole blood was stimulated
               with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides, covering domains of the viral
               spike, nucleocapsid and membrane protein, and the
               interferon-$\gamma$ release was measured (QuantiFERON Monitor
               ELISA, Qiagen). The vast majority of transplant patients (90\%)
               showed neither a detectable humoral nor a T-cell response three
               weeks after the completed two-dose BNT162b2 vaccination; these
               results are in sharp contrast to the robust immunogenicity seen
               in the control group: 98\% exhibited seroconversion after the
               prime dose already, with a further significant increase of IgG
               titres after the booster dose (average > tenfold increase), a
               more than 90\% inhibition capability of neutralizing antibodies
               as well as evidence of a T-cell responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The
               findings of poor immune responses to a two-dose BNT162b2
               vaccination in cardiothoracic transplant patients have a
               significant impact for organ transplant recipients specifically

               (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019
               (COVID-19), presents an intriguing problem with many
               uncertainties underlying their pathogenesis. Despite over 96.2
               million cases of COVID-19 worldwide as of January 22, 2021,
               reports of patients coinfected with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 are
               scarce. It remains unknown whether HIV patients are at a greater
               risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2, despite their
               immunocompromised status. We present a systematic review of the
               literature reporting cases of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfection,
               and examine trends of clinical outcomes among coinfected
               patients. We systematically compiled 63 reports of HIV-1 and
               SARS-CoV-2 coinfection, published as of January 22, 2021. These
               studies were retrieved through targeted search terms applied to
               PubMed/Medline and manual search. Despite scattered evidence,
               reports indicate a favorable prognosis for HIV patients with
               strict adherence to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART).
               However, the presence of comorbidities was associated with a
               poorer prognosis in HIV/SARS-CoV-2 patients, despite cART and
               viral suppression. Studies were limited by geographic coverage,
               small sample size, lack of patient details, and short follow-up
               durations. Although some anti-HIV drugs have shown promising in
               vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, there is no conclusive
               evidence of the clinical efficacy of any anti-HIV drug in the
               treatment of COVID-19. Further research is needed to explain the
               under-representation of severe COVID-19 cases among the HIV
               patient population and to explore the possible protective
               mechanisms of cART in this vulnerable population.",

               nucleocapsid and spike antibodies in sequential samples

               serum samples from 20 individual SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive
               inpatients (n = 172), 20 individual convalescent donors with a
               previous RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 20), were
               deemed positive SARS-CoV-2 samples. RT-PCR-negative inpatients
               (n = 24), and 109 pre-SARS-CoV-2 samples were determined to be
               SARS-CoV-2 negative. Samples were assayed by the Abbott, Roche,
               and Beckman assays. RESULTS: All three assays demonstrated 100\%
               specificity. Abbott, Beckman, and Roche platforms had
               sensitivities of 98\%, 93\%, and 90\% respectively, with the
               difference in sensitivity attributed primarily to samples from
               immunocompromised patients. After the exclusion of samples
               immunocompromised patients, all assays exhibited $\geq$ 95\%

              about the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on
              immunocompromised patients, particularly on those receiving
              B-cell depleting agents and having therefore a severely depressed
              humoral response. Convalescent plasma can be a therapeutic option
              for these patients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of
              convalescent plasma is crucial to optimize such therapeutic
              approach. Here, we describe a COVID-19 patient who was deeply
              immunosuppressed following rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal
              antibody) and concomitant chemotherapy for chronic lymphoid
              leukemia. His long-term severe T and B cell lymphopenia allowed
              to evaluate the treatment effects of convalescent plasma.
              Therapeutic outcome was monitored at the clinical, biological and
              radiological level. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers
              (IgM, IgG and IgA) and neutralizing activity were assessed over
              time before and after plasma transfusions, alongside to
              SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification and virus isolation from the upper
              respiratory tract. Already after the first cycle of plasma
              transfusion, the patient experienced rapid improvement of
              pneumonia, inflammation and blood cell counts, which may be
              related to the immunomodulatory properties of plasma.
              Subsequently, the cumulative increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2
              neutralizing antibodies due to the three additional plasma
              transfusions was associated with progressive and finally complete
              viral clearance, resulting in full clinical recovery. In this
              case-report, administration of convalescent plasma revealed a
              stepwise effect with an initial and rapid anti-inflammatory
              activity followed by the progressive SARS-CoV-2 clearance. These
              data have potential implications for a more extended use of
              convalescent plasma and future monoclonal antibodies in the
              treatment of immunosuppressed COVID-19 patients.",

              hemodialysis are immunocompromised populations that are
              prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination but were excluded from
              clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Antibody titers and
              rates of seroconversion after vaccination are lower among
              patients with CKD and those taking immunosuppressants compared
              with controls. Data are lacking regarding their humoral response
              to vaccination to prevent COVID-19. METHODS: This investigation
              of early serological response after COVID-19 vaccination with the
              Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine included 78 patients
              undergoing hemodialysis, 74 kidney transplant recipients, and
              seven healthy controls. We recorded data from the medical file
              for various clinical parameters, including response to hepatitis
              B vaccination, and measured antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 at
              0, 14, 28, 36, and 58 days after the first injection. RESULTS: In
              controls, we detected antibodies at a positive level (>13
              arbitrary units per ml; AU/ml) at day 14 postinjection, which
              increased progressively to peak at day 36 (1082 AU/ml;
              interquartile range [IQR], 735.0-1662.0). Patients undergoing
              hemodialysis had lower titers that peaked at day 58 (276 AU/ml;
              IQR, 83.4-526.0). We detected a positive antibody level in only
              three transplant recipients at day 36. In patients on
              hemodialysis, those aged 75 years, and serum albumin and Kt/V
              were positively correlated with serological response (P<0.04 and
              P<0.0, respectively); nonresponders to HBV vaccine had the lowest
              anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
              that the postvaccination humoral response is strongly inhibited
              by immunosuppressant therapy in kidney transplant recipients, and
              is reduced by the uremic condition in patients undergoing

               registered in March-April 2020 at medical ward of
               onco-hematological patients in an Spanish hospital. Confirmed
               cases were hospitalized patients, healthcare and non-healthcare
               workers who tested positive by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab.
               Results: Twenty-two COVID-19 cases (12 workers and 10
               inpatients) were laboratory-confirmed. Initial cases were a
               healthcare provider and a visitor who tested positive. The
               median patients age was 73 years (range 62-88). The main reason
               of admission was haematological in 8 patients and oncologic in
               2. All patients followed an immunosuppressive treatment, 5/10
               with high-flow oxygen nebulizations. Five patients presented a
               moderate/serious evolution, and 5 patients died. The mean

               understand the underlying behavioural determinants of SARS-CoV-2
               vaccine hesitancy in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory
               rheumatic diseases (AIIRDs). We aimed to analyse patterns of
               beliefs and intention regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in AIIRD
               patients, as a mean of identifying pragmatic actions that could
               be taken to increase vaccine coverage in this population.
               METHODS: Data relating to 1258 AIIRD patients were analysed
               using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, to
               identify variables associated independently with willingness to
               get vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. Subsets of patients showing
               similar beliefs and intention about SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were
               characterized using cluster analysis. RESULTS: Hierarchical
               cluster analysis identified three distinct clusters of AIIRD
               patients. Three predominant patient attitudes to SARS-COV-2
               vaccination were identified: voluntary, hesitant and suspicious.
               While vaccine willingness differed significantly across the
               three clusters (P < 0.0001), there was no significant difference
               regarding fear of getting COVID-19 (P = 0.11), the presence of
               comorbidities (P = 0.23), the use of glucocorticoids (P = 0.21),
               or immunocompromised status (P = 0.63). However, patients from
               cluster \#2 (hesitant) and \#3 (suspicious) were significantly
               more concerned about vaccination, the use of a new vaccine
               technology, lack of long-term data in relation to COVID-19
               vaccination, and potential financial links with pharmaceutical
               companies (P < 0.0001 in all) than patients from cluster \#1
               (voluntary). DISCUSSION: Importantly, the differences between
               clusters in terms of patient beliefs and intention was not
               related to the fear of getting COVID-19 or to any state of
               frailty, but was related to specific concerns about vaccination.
               This study may serve as a basis for improved communication and
               thus help increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage among AIIRD

               10 kidney transplant recipients with severe COVID-19. MATERIALS
               AND METHODS: The prospective observational cohort study was
               conducted at the Institute of Kidney Disease and Research
               Centre, Ahmedabad, India. All patients were admitted to the
               intensive care unit and received antiviral therapy,
               glucocorticoids, and other supportive care. Two doses of 200 mL
               each of convalescent plasma with neutralization activity of
               >1:640 were transfused into patients 24 hours apart following
               the World Health Organization blood transfusion protocol. The
               endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and
               laboratory parameters within 1 day and 7 days after convalescent
               plasma transfusion. RESULTS: The patients showed resolution of
               clinical symptoms, and there was a significant decrease in
               inflammatory markers (P < .05) within 7 days of convalescent
               plasma transfusion. Of the 10 patients, 9 patients had full
               recovery and 1 patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Convalescent plasma
               therapy is highly safe and clinically feasible and reduces

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is a new
               infectious disease responsible for potentially severe
               respiratory impairment associated with initial
               immunosuppression. Similarly to influenza, several authors have
               described a higher risk of fungal infection after COVID-19, in
               particular for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The main
               objective here is to define the prevalence of invasive pulmonary
               aspergillosis (IPA) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with
               moderate to severe acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS).
               MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a large monocentric
               retrospective study investigating all the ventilated COVID-19
               patients with ARDS hospitalized at Valenciennes' general
               hospital, France, between March 15, 2020 and April 30, 2020. In
               the center a systematic IPA screening strategy was carried out
               for all ARDS patients, with weekly tests of serum galactomannan
               and beta-D-glucan. Bronchoalveolar lavage with culture and chest
               CT scan were performed when the serum assays were positives.
               RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were studied. Their median age
               was 65 years, and 37 of the patients (71\%) were male. Two
               patients had chronic immunosuppression and among all the
               patients, only 2 non-immunocompromised presented a putative IPA
               during their stay. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IPA in this
               cohort of COVID-19 patients (3.7\%) is not higher than what is
               described in the other ARDS populations in the literature. These
               results are however different from the previous publications on
               COVID-19 patients and must therefore be confirmed by larger and

  abstract  = "Since December 2019, Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has
               spread rapidly throughout the world, leading to a global effort
               to develop vaccines and treatments. Despite extensive progress,
               there remains a need for treatments to bolster the immune
               responses in infected immunocompromised individuals, such as
               cancer patients who recently underwent a haematopoietic stem
               cell transplantation. Immunological protection against COVID-19
               is mediated by both short-lived neutralizing antibodies and
               long-lasting virus-reactive T cells. Therefore, we propose that
               T cell therapy may augment efficacy of current treatments. For
               the greatest efficacy with minimal adverse effects, it is
               important that any cellular therapy is designed to be as
               specific and directed as possible. Here, we identify T cells
               from COVID-19 patients with a potentially protective response to
               two major antigens of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Spike and
               Nucleocapsid protein. By generating clones of highly
               virus-reactive CD4+ T cells, we were able to confirm a set of
               nine immunodominant epitopes and characterize T cell responses
               against these. Accordingly, the sensitivity of T cell clones for
               their specific epitope, as well as the extent and focus of their
               cytokine response was examined. Moreover, using an advanced T
               cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach, we determined the
               paired TCR-$\alpha$$\beta$ sequences of clones of interest.
               While these data on a limited population require further
               expansion for universal application, the results presented here
               form a crucial first step towards TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cell

               (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with a high rate of mortality in
               patients with ESKD, and vaccination is hoped to prevent
               infection. METHODS: Between January 18 and February 24, 2021,
               225 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and 45 patients on
               hemodialysis (HDPs) received two injections of mRNA BNT162b2
               vaccine. The postvaccinal humoral and cellular response was
               explored in the first 45 KTRs and ten HDPs. RESULTS: After the
               second dose, eight HDPs (88.9\%) and eight KTRs (17.8\%)
               developed antispike SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (P<0.001). Median
               titers of antibodies in responders were 1052 AU/ml (IQR,
               515-2689) in HDPs and 671 AU/ml (IQR, 172-1523) in KTRs
               (P=0.40). Nine HDPs (100\%) and 26 KTRs (57.8\%) showed a
               specific T cell response (P=0.06) after the second injection. In
               responders, median numbers of spike-reactive T cells were 305
               SFCs per 106 CD3+ T cells (IQR, 95-947) in HDPs and 212 SFCs per
               106 CD3+ T cells (IQR, 61-330) in KTRs (P=0.40). In KTRs, the
               immune response to BNT162b2 seemed influenced by the
               immunosuppressive regimen, particularly tacrolimus or
               belatacept. CONCLUSION: Immunization with BNT162b2 seems more
               efficient in HDPs, indicating that vaccination should be highly
               recommended in these patients awaiting a transplant. However,
               the current vaccinal strategy for KTRs may not provide effective
               protection against COVID-19 and will likely need to be improved.",

               small-molecule, or biologic therapy in the 105 days prior to a

               SARS-CoV-2, in patients with IRD treated with immunomodulating
               drugs and the impact on IRD activity. METHODS: Consecutive
               patients treated at the rheumatology institute, who received
               their first SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer) vaccine, were recruited to the
               study, at their routine visit. They were reassessed 4-6 weeks
               after receiving the second dose of vaccine, and blood samples
               were obtained for serology. IRD activity assessment and the
               vaccine side effects were documented during both visits. IgG
               antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the
               SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott) assay. RESULTS: Two hundred and
               sixty-four patients with stable disease, (mean(SD) age 57.6
               (13.18) years, disease duration 11.06 (7.42) years), were
               recruited. The immunomodulatory therapy was not modified before
               or after the vaccination. After the second vaccination, 227
               patients (86\%) mounted IgG Ab against SARS-CoV-2 (mean (SD)

               treated with B cell-depleting agents. The reported side effects
               of the vaccine were minor. The rheumatic disease remained stable
               in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of patients with
               IRD developed a significant humoral response following the
               administration of the second dose of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine
               against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Only minor side effects were reported

               (COVID-19), patients with the illness have presented with
               considerable variation in severity. Some infected individuals
               present mild or no symptoms, while others present severe illness
               with some fatal outcomes. Multiple lines of management have been
               suggested for critically ill patients, such as intravenous
               immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids. IVIG is the main treatment
               for patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Multiple studies
               have reported that these patients have excellent outcomes when
               they contract COVID-19. This report describes the clinical
               course of COVID-19 pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a 19-year-old
               man on IVIG replacement therapy for X-linked agammaglobulinemia
               (XLA). CASE REPORT A patient with XLA receiving a monthly dose
               of IVIG and having bronchiectasis managed by prophylactic
               azithromycin presented with fever, shortness of breath,
               productive cough, and diarrhea. He was admitted to our hospital
               with SARS-CoV-2 infection. His treatment course for COVID-19 was
               uncomplicated and had excellent results. He completed a 10-day
               course of piperacillin/tazobactam and his symptoms resolved 3
               days after admission, without complications, oxygen
               supplementation, or intensive care unit admission. CONCLUSIONS
               Patients with XLA have weakened immunity and therefore may
               present with an infection as a first symptom. This report
               describes the mild course of COVID-19 pneumonia in an
               immunologically vulnerable patient with XLA who presented with
               SARS-CoV-2 infection while undergoing IVIG replacement therapy.

               remains poorly understood. METHODS: To analyze initial and
               long-term humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis
               population, we retrospectively evaluated findings from
               SARS-CoV-2 IgG serologic assays targeting the nucleocapsid
               antigen or spike antigen up to 6 months of follow-up in patients
               on hemodialysis in the Paris, France, region who had recovered
               from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Our analysis
               included 83 patients (median age 65 years); 59 (71\%) were male
               and 28 (34\%) had presented with severe COVID-19. We observed
               positive initial SARS-CoV-2 IgG antinucleocapsid serology in 74
               patients (89\%) at a median of 67 days postdiagnosis. By
               multivariable analysis, immunocompromised status was the only
               factor significantly associated with lack of an IgG
               antinucleocapsid antibody response. Follow-up data were
               available at 6 months postdiagnosis for 60 of 74 patients (81\%)
               with positive initial antinucleocapsid serology, and 15 (25\%)
               of them had negative antinucleocapsid serology at month 6. In
               total, 14 of 15 sera were tested for antispike antibodies, 3 of
               14 (21\%) of which were also negative. Overall, 97\% of
               antinucleocapsid-antibody-positive specimens were also
               antispike-antibody positive. Female sex, age >70 years, and
               nonsevere clinical presentation were independently associated
               with faster IgG antinucleocapsid titer decay in multivariable
               analysis. After adjustment for sex and age >70 years, nonsevere
               clinical presentation was the only factor associated with faster
               decay of IgG antispike antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: This study
               characterizes evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in
               patients on hemodialysis and identifies factors that are

               more than 9.1 million cases and more than 4.7 lakh death has
               been reported globally. Children, pregnant women, elderly
               population, immunocompromised patients, and patients with
               conditions like asthma, diabetes, etc. are highly vulnerable to
               COVID infection. Currently, there is no treatment available for
               COVID-19 infection. Traditional medicinal plants have provided
               bioactive molecules in the past that are efficiently used during
               conditions like cancer, malaria, microbial infections,
               immune-compromised states, etc. AYUSH India has recommended the
               use of Curcuma longa, Allium sativum, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and
               Withania somnifera for immune-boosting during SARS-CoV-2
               infection. In the present study, we investigated the potential
               of 63-major bioactive molecules of these plants against
               SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) through docking studies and
               compared the results with known inhibitor 11a. Our results
               proposed cuscohygrine, $\gamma$-Glutamyl-S-allylcysteine,
               anahygrine, and S-allylcystein as the potent inhibitors against
               Mpro identified using molecular docking and molecular simulation
               dynamics. Interestingly, these molecules are from A. sativum,
               and W. somnifera, which are known for their antimicrobial and
               immunomodulatory potential. None of the proposed molecules have
               earlier been reported as antiviral molecules. Our results
               predict very strong potential of these four-molecules against
               SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, especially $\gamma$-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine,
               as all four form hydrogen bonding with Glu166 that is a crucial
               residue for the formation of the biologically active dimeric
               form of Mpro. Therefore, we strongly recommend further research

               still spreading rapidly around the world. Recent cases with
               prolonged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

               the phenomenon of false-negative real-time polymerase chain
               reaction (RT-PCR) results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or ``repositive''
               was also described in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We report a
               69-year-old female patient with hypertension, suspected lung
               tumor, and previous history of total hysterectomy for
               hysteromyoma who presented with moderate COVID-19 symptoms and
               was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR when she traveled from
               the USA to China. RESULTS: The patient required second and third
               re-hospitalizations due to ``repositive'' SARS-CoV-2 throat swab
               test results during post-charge solitary isolation and
               observation, and serum SARS-CoV-2-IgG decayed rapidly before
               disappearing on illness Day 139 when the throat swab was still
               positive. The virus shedding lasted for at least 146 days (the
               last positive throat swab test result was on illness Day 146,
               and the first true-negative test result was on illness Day 151)
               since her initial positive test. CONCLUSION: Prolonged
               SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral shedding is prone to occur in an
               immunocompromised host, wherein changes in the host immune
               status can lead to repeated positive SARS-CoV-2 detection.
               Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2-IgG may decrease rapidly and disappear
               before virus removal, indicating there may be certain
               limitations on the protective effect of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody,

               SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and is susceptible to all
               populations. Immunosuppressed patients have greater risk for
               opportunistic infections. However, the understanding regarding
               the biological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed
               patients remains unclear. Herein, we present a case of prolonged
               shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in a liver transplant patient with
               COVID-19. A 61-year-old male post liver transplant was confirmed
               COVID-19 infection on day 10 of illness onset. The patient has
               received immunosuppressive treatment for over 11 years and has a
               history of hypertension for 10 years. With antiviral treatment
               and temporary discontinuation of tacrolimus immunosuppression,
               he had complete clinical symptoms relieve on day 24. However,
               recurrently positive tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were presented on
               day 35 and on day 39 after two consecutive negative tests. IgG
               antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive with IgM negative on
               day 41. The final shedding duration lasted 52 days. Prolonged
               shedding of SARS-CoV-2 should be a matter of concern and might
               attribute to long-term immunosuppression. Therefore, dynamic
               surveillance and prolonged quarantine are required for
               immunocompromised individuals. Further data should be collected
               to investigate if there is a universal prolonged shedding window

               serve as a reservoir for mutation accumulation and subsequent
               emergence of novel strains with the potential to evade immune
               responses. METHODS: We describe three patients with acute
               lymphoblastic leukemia who were persistently positive for
               SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viral
               viability from longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed.
               Whole-genome sequencing and serological studies were performed
               to measure viral evolution and evidence of immune escape.
               FINDINGS: We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication
               and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by
               subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis.
               Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune
               responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the
               potential for immune escape. INTERPRETATION: Our results
               highlight the potential need to reassess infection control
               precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised
               patients. Routine surveillance of mutations and evaluation of

               comorbidities and recurring contacts with the healthcare system.
               Due to the COVID-19 pandemic transplant numbers have dropped
               considerably, further increasing waiting times in this high-risk
               population. On the other hand, knowledge of the severity of

               We present a case report of a successful kidney transplantation
               only 65 days after the recipient was hospitalized for treatment
               of COVID-19 pneumonia. In a follow up of 9 months, we observed
               no signs of recurrent disease and transplant function is
               excellent. Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 antibody response demonstrates
               stable IgG levels. CONCLUSION: This reassuring case provides
               guidance to transplant centers how to proceed with kidney
               transplantation safely during the pandemic. Careful
               consideration of risks and benefits of the organ offer, full
               recovery from COVID-19 symptoms and the presence of a positive

               threatens our ability to achieve herd immunity for COVID-19.
               These novel SARS-CoV-2 variants often harbor multiple point
               mutations, conferring one or more evolutionarily advantageous
               traits, such as increased transmissibility, immune evasion and
               longer infection duration. In a number of cases, variant
               emergence has been linked to long-term infections in individuals
               who were either immunocompromised or treated with convalescent
               plasma. In this paper, we used a stochastic evolutionary
               modeling framework to explore the emergence of fitter variants
               of SARS-CoV-2 during long-term infections. We found that
               increased viral load and infection duration favor emergence of
               such variants. While the overall probability of emergence and
               subsequent transmission from any given infection is low, on a
               population level these events occur fairly frequently. Targeting
               these low-probability stochastic events that lead to the
               establishment of novel advantageous viral variants might allow
               us to slow the rate at which they emerge in the patient
               population, and prevent them from spreading deterministically
               due to natural selection. Our work thus suggests practical ways
               to achieve control of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infections, which

               (WHO) declared Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) a pandemic.
               Hospitals around the world began to implement infection
               prevention and control (IPC) measures to stop further spread and
               prevent infections within their facilities. Healthcare
               organizations were challenged to develop response plans, procure
               personal protective equipment (PPE) that was in limited supply
               while continuing to provide quality, safe care. METHODS: As a
               comprehensive cancer center with immunocompromised patients, our
               efforts began immediately. Preventative measures were
               established and, as of September 2020, over 14,000 patients have
               been tested within the facility. From March 2020 through
               September 2020, only one case of hospital acquired (HA) COVID-19
               was identified among our patients. Two cases of suspected
               community acquired (SCA) cases were also identified. Following
               the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, IPC measures
               were implemented within the facility as information science
               about the virus developed. This article addresses the IPC
               measures taken, such as enhancing isolation precautions,
               implementing screening protocols, disinfecting and reusing N95
               respirators, by the center throughout the pandemic as well as
               the challenges that arouse with a new and emerging infectious

               at our comprehensive cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic
               allowed our center to continue to provide world class cancer

               mortality in western Europe is limited, and none of the
               published survival studies have used a competing risk approach.
               This study aims to identify risk factors for in-hospital
               mortality in COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands, considering
               recovery as a competing risk. METHODS: In this observational
               multicenter cohort study we included adults with PCR-confirmed
               SARS-CoV-2 infection that were admitted to one of five hospitals
               in the Netherlands (March to May 2020). We performed a competing
               risk survival analysis, presenting cause-specific hazard ratios
               (HRCS) for the effect of preselected factors on the absolute
               risk of death and recovery. RESULTS: 1,006 patients were
               included (63.9\% male; median age 69 years, IQR: 58-77).
               Patients were hospitalized for a median duration of 6 days (IQR:
               3-13); 243 (24.6\%) of them died, 689 (69.9\%) recovered, and 74
               (7.4\%) were censored. Patients with higher age (HRCS 1.10, 95\%
               CI 1.08-1.12), immunocompromised state (HRCS 1.46, 95\% CI
               1.08-1.98), who used anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication
               (HRCS 1.38, 95\% CI 1.01-1.88), with higher modified early
               warning score (MEWS) (HRCS 1.09, 95\% CI 1.01-1.18), and higher
               blood LDH at time of admission (HRCS 6.68, 95\% CI 1.95-22.8)
               had increased risk of death, whereas fever (HRCS 0.70, 95\% CI
               0.52-0.95) decreased risk of death. We found no increased
               mortality risk in male patients, high BMI or diabetes.

               to absolute decreases in pediatric PCV13 vaccination of >50\%

               vaccination was unfavorable if absolute decreases in pediatric

               COVID-19-related decreases in pediatric PCV13 use would need to

               recipients with respiratory symptoms, we aimed to analyze and

               through multiplex PCR assays during the study period. We
               identified 188 consecutive allo-HSCT recipients with 406
               episodes screened for CSRV during the study period, of which 147
               developed 300 CSRV. In P1 and P2 we diagnosed 115 (38.3\%) and
               145 (48.3\%) CSRV episodes, respectively, whereas in P3 only 40
               (13.3\%) episodes were detected (p < 0.001). During P3, we
               observed a reduction of 80.2\% in Ev/Rh, 93.3\% in RSV, 80\% in
               hIV, 96.3\% HPIV, 68.4\% in hMPV, 77.7\% in ADV, 100\% in HBoV,
               and 53.6\% in HCoV as compared to P1 and P2. Consequently, we

               nine allo-HSCT recipients, representing 23\% of all CSRV
               detections in that period. In conclusion, we provide evidence of
               a significant drop in CSRV circulation during the SARS-COV-2
               pandemic in our allo-HSCT recipients, indicating that prevention

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: In light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, protecting
               vulnerable groups has become a high priority. Persons at risk of
               severe disease, for example, those receiving immunosuppressive
               therapies for chronic inflammatory cdiseases (CIDs), are
               prioritised for vaccination. However, data concerning generation
               of protective antibody titres in immunosuppressed patients are
               scarce. Additionally, mRNA vaccines represent a new vaccine
               technology leading to increased insecurity especially in
               patients with CID. OBJECTIVE: Here we present for the first
               time, data on the efficacy and safety of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
               vaccines in a cohort of immunosuppressed patients as compared
               with healthy controls. METHODS: 42 healthy controls and 26
               patients with CID were included in this study (mean age 37.5 vs
               50.5 years). Immunisations were performed according to national
               guidelines with mRNA vaccines. Antibody titres were assessed by
               ELISA before initial vaccination and 7 days after secondary
               vaccination. Disease activity and side effects were assessed
               prior to and 7 days after both vaccinations. RESULTS:
               Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as well as neutralising activity
               could be detected in all study participants. IgG titres were
               significantly lower in patients as compared with controls (2053
               binding antibody units (BAU)/mL $\pm$1218 vs 2685$\pm$1102).
               Side effects were comparable in both groups. No severe adverse
               effects were observed, and no patients experienced a disease
               flare. CONCLUSION: We show that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines lead to
               development of antibodies in immunosuppressed patients without
               considerable side effects or induction of disease flares.
               Despite the small size of this cohort, we were able to
               demonstrate the efficiency and safety of mRNA vaccines in our

               respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2
               infection, but there has been little evidence of its efficacy.
               OBJECTIVES: To describe the effect of ECMO rescue therapy on
               patient-important outcomes in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2.
               METHODS: A case series study was conducted for the
               laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients who were admitted to
               the ICUs of 22 Saudi hospitals, between March 1, 2020, and
               October 30, 2020, by reviewing patient's medical records
               prospectively. RESULTS: ECMO use was associated with higher
               in-hospital mortality (40.2\% vs. 48.9\%; p = 0.000); lower
               COVID-19 virological cure (41.3\% vs 14.1\%, p = 0.000); and
               longer hospitalization (20.2 days vs 29.1 days; p = 0.000), ICU
               stay (12.6 vs 26 days; p = 0.000) and mechanical ventilation use
               (14.2 days vs 22.4 days; p = 0.000) compared to non-ECMO group.
               Also, there was a high number of patients with septic shock
               (19.6\%) and multiple organ failure (10.9\%); and more
               complications occurred at any time during hospitalization
               [pneumothorax (5\% vs 29.3\%, p = 0.000), bleeding requiring
               blood transfusion (7.1\% vs 38\%, p = 0.000), pulmonary embolism
               (6.4\% vs 15.2\%, p = 0.016), and gastrointestinal bleeding
               (3.3\% vs 8.7\%, p = 0.017)] in the ECMO group. However, PaO2
               was significantly higher in the 72-h post-ECMO initiation group
               and PCO2 was significantly lower in the 72-h post-ECMO start
               group than those in the 12-h pre-ECMO group (62.9 vs. 70 mmHg, p
               = 0.002 and 61.8 vs. 51 mmHg, p = 0.042, respectively).
               CONCLUSION: Following the use of ECMO, the mortality rate of
               patients and length of ICU and hospital stay were not improved.
               However, these findings need to be carefully interpreted, as
               most of our cohort patients were relatively old and had multiple
               severe comorbidities. Future randomized trials, although
               challenging to conduct, are highly needed to confirm or dispute

               visited patients daily and then returned to the clinic to
               formulate a plan of care with the interprofessional care team.
               Transplantation RNs visited patients on the same day to provide
               the prescribed care. FINDINGS: Based on evaluations from 32
               patients and 12 providers, the results indicated that home care
               was safe, feasible, and beneficial for patient care post-HSCT

               Guillain-Barr{\'e} spectrum syndromes have been thought to be

               progressed to a state of descending paralysis involving the

               eventually developed quadriparesis. Electromyography and a nerve

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: It is important to predict which patients infected
               by SARS-CoV-2 are at higher risk of life-threatening COVID-19.
               Several studies suggest that neutralizing auto-antibodies
               (auto-Abs) against type I interferons (IFNs) are predictive of
               critical COVID-19 pneumonia. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test for
               auto-Abs to type I IFN and describe the main characteristics of
               COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care depending on
               whether or not these auto-Abs are present. METHODS:
               Retrospective analysis of all COVID-19 patients admitted to an
               intensive care unit (ICU) in whom samples were available, from
               March 2020 to March 2021, in Barcelona, Spain. RESULTS: A total
               of 275 (70.5\%) out of 390 patients admitted to ICU were tested
               for type I IFNs auto-antibodies ($\alpha$2 and/or $\omega$) by
               ELISA, being positive in 49 (17.8\%) of them. Blocking activity
               of plasma diluted 1/10 for high concentrations (10 ng/mL) of
               IFNs was proven in 26 (9.5\%) patients. Almost all the patients
               with neutralizing auto-Abs were men (92.3\%). ICU patients with
               positive results for neutralizing IFNs auto-Abs did not show
               relevant differences in demographic, comorbidities, clinical
               features, and mortality, when compared with those with negative
               results. Nevertheless, some laboratory tests (leukocytosis,
               neutrophilia, thrombocytosis) related with COVID-19 severity, as
               well as acute kidney injury (17 [65.4\%] vs. 100 [40.2\%]; p =
               0.013) were significantly higher in patients with auto-Abs.
               CONCLUSION: Auto-Abs neutralizing high concentrations of type I
               IFNs were found in 9.5\% of patients admitted to the ICU for
               COVID-19 pneumonia in a hospital in Barcelona. These auto-Abs
               should be tested early upon diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
               as they account for a significant proportion of life-threatening

               continues to spread around the world. Vaccines that elicit
               protective immunity have reduced infection and mortality,
               however new viral variants are arising that may evade
               vaccine-induced immunity or cause disease in individuals who are
               unable to develop robust vaccine-induced responses.
               Investigating the role of viral variants in causing severe
               disease, evading vaccine-elicited immunity, and infecting
               vulnerable individuals is important for developing strategies to
               control the pandemic. Here, we report fourteen breakthrough
               infections of SARS-CoV-2 in vaccinated individuals with symptoms
               ranging from asymptomatic/mild (6/14) to severe disease (8/14).
               High viral loads with a median Ct value of 19.6 were detected in
               the nasopharyngeal specimens from subjects regardless of disease
               severity. Sequence analysis revealed four distinct virus
               lineages, including alpha and gamma variants of concern.
               Immunosuppressed individuals were more likely to be hospitalized
               after infection (p = 0.047), however no specific variant was
               associated with severe disease. Our results highlight the high
               viral load that can occur in asymptomatic breakthrough
               infections and the vulnerability of immunosuppressed individuals
               to post-vaccination infections by diverse variants of

               patients, data on safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for
               recipients of solid organ transplantations are scarce. AIMS: Our
               study offers a synthesis of expert opinions aligned with
               available data addressing key questions of the clinical
               management of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations for transplant patients.
               METHOD: An online research was performed retrieving available
               recommendations by national and international transplantation
               organizations and state institutions on SARS-CoV2 vaccination
               management for transplant recipients. RESULTS: Eleven key
               statements were identified from recommendations by 18 national
               and international societies, and consensus for the individual
               statements was evaluated by means of the Society Recommendation
               Consensus score. The highest consensus level (SRC A) was found
               for prioritized access to vaccination for transplant patients
               despite anticipation of a weakened immune response. All
               currently authorized vaccines can be considered safe for
               transplant patients (SRC A). The handling of immunosuppressive
               medication, the timely management of vaccines, and other aspects
               were aligned with available expert opinions. CONCLUSION: Expert
               consensus can be determined for crucial aspects of the
               implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programs. We hereby

               PRESENTATION: This study retrospectively identified 13 white
               (Iranian) heart transplant patients with coronavirus disease
               2019 between December 2019 and October 2020. The mean age of
               patients was 43.7 years (19-65 years); seven (70\%) were men.
               Laboratory and treatment data were collected for those admitted

               everyday life. Patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) are
               in a particularly difficult situation. The purpose of the
               present study was to contribute to the very limited research on
               the everyday aspects of functioning in PID patients during the
               COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The survey included 85 adult PID
               patients treated with immunoglobulin replacement therapy in four
               reference centers for immunology. Everyday functioning of the
               patients as well as their opinion concerning new solutions in
               medical care were analyzed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the
               percentage of patients experiencing fear/anxiety has increased
               from 47\% to 70\%. The wide dissemination of information about
               the SARS-CoV-2 in the media has increased anxiety in 40\% of the
               patients. Patients diagnosed with PID were most afraid of the
               exposure to contact with strangers, especially in public places.
               As many as 67 respondents (79\%) considered the introduction of
               restrictions concerning social functioning as good. Only every
               fifth person learned about the pandemic from reliable sources.
               Eighty three percent of the patients receiving immunoglobulin
               substitution experienced less fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
               patients positively evaluated the solutions related to the
               direct delivery of drugs to the place of residence in order to
               continue home IgRT therapy. Fifty three respondents (62.5\%)
               believed that the possibility of a remote consultation was a
               very good solution. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to increase
               educational activities concerning the pandemic provided by
               health care professionals, as patients obtain information mainly
               from the media and the Internet, which adversely affects the
               feeling of anxiety. The pandemic, in addition to the very
               negative impact on patients and the deterioration of their daily
               functioning, has made patients appreciate their life more,
               devote more time to family and friends, and do things they like.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 has highlighted
               deficiencies in the testing capacity of many developed countries
               during the early stages of pandemics. Here we describe a
               strategy using pan-family viral assays to improve early
               accessibility of large-scale nucleic acid testing. METHODS:
               Coronaviruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
               2 (SARS-CoV-2) were used as a case study for assessing utility
               of pan-family viral assays during the early stages of a novel
               pandemic. Specificity of a pan-coronavirus (Pan-CoV) assay for a
               novel pathogen was assessed using the frequency of common human
               coronavirus (HCoV) species in key populations. A reported
               Pan-CoV assay was assessed to determine sensitivity to 60
               reference coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The resilience of
               the primer target regions of this assay to mutation was assessed
               in 8893 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes to predict ongoing
               utility during pandemic progression. RESULTS: Because of common
               HCoV species, a Pan-CoV assay would return false positives for
               as few as 1\% of asymptomatic adults, but up to 30\% of
               immunocompromised patients with respiratory disease. One-half of
               reported Pan-CoV assays identify SARS-CoV-2 and with small
               adjustments can accommodate diverse variation observed in animal
               coronaviruses. The target region of 1 well-established Pan-CoV
               assay is highly resistant to mutation compared to
               species-specific SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase
               chain reaction assays. CONCLUSIONS: Despite cross-reactivity
               with common pathogens, pan-family assays may greatly assist
               management of emerging pandemics through prioritization of
               high-resolution testing or isolation measures. Targeting highly
               conserved genomic regions make pan-family assays robust and
               resilient to mutation. A strategic stockpile of pan-family
               assays may improve containment of novel diseases before the
               availability of species-specific assays.",

               external clinical validation of performance characteristics is
               of paramount importance. METHODS: Four fully automated assays,
               Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Siemens
               SARS-CoV-2 total (COV2T) and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (COV2G) were
               evaluated using 350 pre-pandemic samples and 700 samples from
               245 COVID-19 patients (158 hospitalized, 87 outpatients).
               RESULTS: All tests showed very high diagnostic specificity.
               Sensitivities in samples collected at least 14 days after
               disease onset were slightly lower than manufacturers' claims for
               Roche (93.0\%), Abbott (90.8\%), and Siemens COV2T (90.3\%), and
               distinctly lower for Siemens COV2G (78.8\%). Concordantly
               negative results were enriched for immunocompromised patients.
               ROC curve analyses suggest a lowering of the cut-off index for
               the Siemens COV2G assay. Finally, the combination of two
               anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is feasible when considering
               borderline reactive results. CONCLUSIONS: Thorough on-site
               evaluation of commercially available serologic tests for
               detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 remains imperative
               for laboratories. The potentially impaired sensitivity of the

               of neutralising the virus. However, multiple variants have
               emerged with mutations in the spike protein amongst others, the
               key target of neutralising antibodies. We evaluated the
               neutralising efficacy of 89 serum samples from patients,
               infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning of 2020, against two
               virus variants isolated from acutely infected patients and
               harbouring spike protein mutations. One isolate was assigned to
               lineage B.1.351 (MUC-IMB-B.1.351) whilst the other (MUC-484) was
               isolated from an immunocompromised patient, sharing some but not
               all mutations with B.1.351 and representing a transitional
               variant. Both variants showed a significant reduction in
               neutralisation sensitivity compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with
               MUC-IMB-B.1.351 being almost completely resistant to
               neutralisation. The observed reduction in neutralising activity
               of wild-type-specific antibodies against both variants suggests
               that individual mutations in the spike protein are sufficient to
               confer a potent escape from the humoral immune response. In
               addition, the effect of escape mutations seems to accumulate, so
               that more heavily mutated variants show a greater loss of
               sensitivity to neutralisation up to complete insensitivity as
               observed for MUC-IMB-B.1.351. From a clinical point of view,
               this might affect the efficacy of (monoclonal) antibody
               treatment of patients with prolonged infections as well as
               patients infected with variants other than the donor. At the
               same, this could also negatively influence the efficacy of
               current vaccines (as they are based on wild-type spike protein)
               emphasising the need to thoroughly surveil the emergence and
               distribution of variants and adapt vaccines and therapeutics

               this study, we compared immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA

               (n = 53) who were on active cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy to a
               control cohort of participants without cancer (n = 50).
               Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 67\% of patients with
               cancer after the first immunization, followed by a threefold
               increase in median titers after the second dose. Similar
               patterns were observed for spike protein-specific serum
               antibodies and T cells, but the magnitude of each of these
               responses was diminished relative to the control cohort. In most
               patients with cancer, we detected spike receptor-binding domain
               and other S1-specific memory B cell subsets as potential
               predictors of anamnestic responses to additional immunizations.
               We therefore initiated a phase 1 trial for 20 cancer cohort
               participants of a third vaccine dose of BNT162b2 ( NCT04936997
               ); primary outcomes were immune responses, with a secondary
               outcome of safety. At 1 week after a third immunization, 16
               participants demonstrated a median threefold increase in
               neutralizing antibody responses, but no improvement was observed
               in T cell responses. Adverse events were mild. These results
               suggest that a third dose of BNT162b2 is safe, improves humoral
               immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and could be immunologically

               first lockdown. The mean age of the patients was 42,2 years and
               four were male. Two patients were immunocompromised. Repeated
               surgical drainage was performed in all patients, whereas four
               were also subjected to elective tracheostomy during their first
               operation. The mean hospitalization duration was 55,4 days and
               mortality was 40\%. During the first lockdown for the Covid-19,
               a rise in the ratio of DNM cases to the overall incidence of
               cervicofacial infections was observed in our department. All
               patients with DNM were operated on an emergency basis and were
               subsequently admitted to the ICU. We consider the effect of the
               quarantine as a decisive factor for this escalation, because
               according to the department archives, there had not been any
               cases of DNM originating from a dental infection, for the past 5
               years. Additionally, past studies from the same department
               reported no more than 6 cases over a 10 year period.",

  abstract = "Dear Editor, The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19) was declared by the World Health Organization on March
              11, 2020, and remains a global challenge. COVID-19 is caused by
              severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
              transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets and aerosols.
              Even though the COVID-19 vaccine has become available since
              December 2020, the main preventive measures still include social
              distancing, hand washing, and the use of protective face masks.
              By May 22, 2021, 3,437,545 deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 have been
              registered by WHO, confirming the burden of this disease (1).
              Consequently, the pandemic has become a challenge for health care
              systems, as they had to be focused on the care of patients with
              COVID-19. During the first lockdown from March to May 2020, it
              was advised to postpone clinical visits whenever this could be
              done without risk. This recommendation was mainly aimed at older
              patients and those with chronic diseases, as it has been shown
              that they are at greater risk for complications from COVID-19.
              Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are at a greater risk for
              infections and different cancers due to their permanent
              immunosuppressive therapy. The most common malignancies in RTRs
              are skin cancers, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers. It has
              been estimated that RTRs have a 65-250 times higher risk for
              cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 10 times higher risk for
              basal cell carcinoma, and 2-5 times higher risk for melanoma when
              compared with the general population (2-4). RTRs are at a higher
              risk for complications from COVID-19, not only because of their
              immunosuppressive therapy but also because of different
              comorbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and
              diabetes mellitus (5). Therefore, RTRs tend to limit their
              medical visits and postpone clinical examinations for skin cancer
              screenings. Moreover, during clinical visits the patients are
              commonly asked to keep their protective masks on, increasing the
              risk of overlooking their facial skin changes. Herein we present
              two RTRs who developed skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic,
              and the tumors were diagnosed with a significant delay. Patient 1
              A 67-year-old woman with unknown primary kidney disease received
              a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2014. The
              immunosuppressive protocol included antithymocyte globulin
              induction with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid
              maintenance. In January 2020, she had noticed a reddish squamous
              lesion on her right cheek, which enlarged slowly. Since there
              were no other symptoms, she postponed the dermatologic
              examination. Additionally, she further postponed the visit to her
              physician during the pandemic as she wanted to avoid social
              contact as much as possible. One year later, at the
              nephrologist's examination, she was asked to take off her face
              mask for a skin check, and two skin tumors on her right cheek
              were noticed (Figure 1). One lesion was located at the angle of
              her mandible and presented as a hypertrophic, sharply marginated
              lesion with central crusting and a diameter of 2 cm. The other
              lesion was at the right zygomatic region and appeared as a scaly,
              erythematous lesion with a diameter of 7 mm. The patient was
              referred to a dermatologist, and a biopsy of both lesions was
              indicated. The pathohistological analysis revealed cutaneous SCC
              in situ for the mandibular lesion and actinic keratosis for the
              zygomatic lesion. SCC in situ has been excised, and actinic
              keratosis was treated by cryosurgery. Patient 2 A 66-year-old
              woman received a renal allograft from a deceased donor in 2010
              due to chronic glomerulonephritis without biopsy. The
              immunosuppressive protocol included basiliximab induction with
              tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid maintenance. In
              June 2020, an erosion occurred at her left infraocular area and
              did not heal but instead gradually enlarged. The patient
              suspected that the ``wound'' developed due to the friction from
              the rim of her eyeglasses. Six months later, the nephrologist
              noticed the erosion which was 10$\times$5 mm in size with a
              slightly elevated, pearl-colored margin (Figure 2). The patient
              was referred to a dermatologist who indicated tumor excision due
              to suspected basal cell carcinoma. The pathohistological analysis
              confirmed the clinical diagnosis. DISCUSSION Both presented
              patients did not inform their family physicians about their skin
              changes because they avoided all non-nephrological medical visits
              during the pandemic. The additional reason for the diagnostic
              delay was the fact that they kept the masks on their faces during
              most examinations, with the skin lesions behind the mask
              consequently remaining unnoticed. The problem of diagnostic delay
              of skin cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized
              by several studies. Canadian authors compared the number of
              biopsies for skin cancers during the first 15 weeks in 2020 and
              during the same period in 2019. They found a decrease in the
              number of biopsies for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and
              melanoma of 18\% and 27\%, respectively (6). A multicenter study
              performed in northern-central Italy showed that the number of
              skin cancer (NMSC and melanoma) diagnoses fell by 56.7\% in weeks
              11 to 20 of 2020 compared with the average number noted in the
              same periods of 2018 and 2019 (7). Furthermore, a single-center
              retrospective study in Italy demonstrated that the number of
              advanced skin cancers surgically treated between May 18 and
              November 18, 2020, was significantly higher than in the same
              period in 2019. These findings led the authors to conclude that
              the surgical excisions were postponed due to the delay in
              follow-ups, which resulted in increased incidence of advanced
              skin cancers (8). RTRs are at particular risk of severe
              consequences from diagnostic delay with regard to skin cancers.
              Namely, skin cancers in RTRs are more aggressive and are
              associated with a higher incidence rate of metastases and
              recurrences than in the general population (9). Therefore, RTRs
              should be advised to regularly check their skin for potential
              skin cancer, which includes self-examinations and dermatologic
              follow-ups.",

               rituximab (RTX) affects humoral immune response after
               vaccination. It remains unclear whether RTX-treated patients can
               develop a humoral and T-cell-mediated immune response against
               SARS-CoV-2 after immunisation. METHODS: Patients under RTX
               treatment (n=74) were vaccinated twice with either mRNA-1273 or
               BNT162b2. Antibodies were quantified using the Elecsys
               Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay against the receptor-binding
               domain (RBD) of the spike protein and neutralisation tests.
               SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses were quantified by
               IFN-$\gamma$ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays.
               Prepandemic healthy individuals (n=5), as well as healthy
               individuals (n=10) vaccinated with BNT162b2, served as controls.
               RESULTS: All healthy controls developed antibodies against the
               SARS-CoV-2 RBD of the spike protein, but only 39\% of the
               patients under RTX treatment seroconverted. Antibodies against
               SARS-CoV-2 RBD significantly correlated with neutralising
               antibodies ($\tau$=0.74, p<0.001). Patients without detectable
               CD19+ peripheral B cells (n=36) did not develop specific
               antibodies, except for one patient. Circulating B cells
               correlated with the levels of antibodies ($\tau$=0.4, p<0.001).
               However, even patients with a low number of B cells (<1\%)
               mounted detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses.
               SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in 58\% of the
               patients, independent of a humoral immune response. CONCLUSIONS:
               The data suggest that vaccination can induce SARS-CoV-2-specific
               antibodies in RTX-treated patients, once peripheral B cells at
               least partially repopulate. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific T
               cells that evolved in more than half of the vaccinated patients
               may exert protective effects independent of humoral immune
               responses.",

               in recent years owing to its ability to cause hospital
               infections and epidemics, resistant to antifungal agents and
               disinfection processes and frequently misidentified by
               commercial systems. Hospital outbreaks caused by C.auris have
               been reported from some countries. It has been determined that
               C.auris has lower virulence than Candida albicans; however, it
               is associated with high mortality rates in immunocompromised
               individuals. An increase in the incidence of invasive fungal
               infections which can lead to serious complications and death,
               has been identified in severe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19)
               patients or immunocompromised individuals with underlying
               disease. Studies demonstrated an increase in the frequency of
               C.auris isolation in COVID-19 patients with candidemia. In this
               report, the first case of COVID-19 positive C.auris fungemia
               detected in Turkey was presented. A 71-year-old male patient
               with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus,
               donation of a single kidney and lobectomy surgery due to lung
               cancer was hospitalized in the pandemic thoracic surgery service
               due to the findings consistent with viral pneumonia on thoracic
               computed tomography. Favipiravir 2 x 600 mg and intravenous
               dexamethasone 1 x 6 mg therapy was administered. The patient
               tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, and
               severe involvement of the left lung was detected in the
               following days. Antibiotics were administered, followed by
               insertion of a right jugular vein catheter and initation of
               tocilizumab. The patient was transferred to the intensive care
               unit due to increased respiratory distress. Yeast growth was
               detected in the patient's hemoculture. The yeast strain could
               not be identified using API ID 32C (bioMerieux, France)
               (Sacchromyces kluyveri, Candida sake, unacceptable profile), but
               was identified as C.auris using the VITEK MALDI TOF MS
               (bioMerieux, France) (99.9\%) system and confirmed by
               sequencing. The minimum inhibitor concentration values were
               detected as 3 µg/ml for amphotericin B; > 256 µg/ml for
               fluconazole; 0.19 µg/ml for voriconazole; 0.19 µg/ml for
               itraconazole; 0.016 µg/ml for posaconazole; 1 µg/ml for
               caspofungin and 0.094 µg/ml for anidulafungin by using the
               antibiotic gradient method. The patient's initial treatment
               comprised meropenem 3 x 1 g, vancomycin 2 x 1 g, caspofungin 1 x
               70 mg, and continued as caspofungine 1 x 50 mg after the loading

               and RP-ILD which led to a fatal outcome, further aggravated by
               SARS-CoV-2 infection. She was referred to our hospital after
               being diagnosed with anti-MDA5 JDM and respiratory failure due
               to RP-ILD. On admission, fibrobronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar
               lavage (BAL) revealed Pneumocystis jirovecii infection so
               treatment with intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was
               initiated. Due to RP-ILD worsening, immunosuppressive therapy
               was intensified using methylprednisolone pulses,
               cyclophosphamide, tofacitinib and intravenous immunoglobulin
               without response. She developed severe hypoxemic respiratory
               failure, pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax, further complicated
               with severe RP-ILD and cervical subcutaneous emphysema. Three
               real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were made with a negative
               result. In addition, she was complicated with a secondary
               hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and a fourth real-time PCR
               for SARS-CoV-2 performed in BAS sample was positive. Despite
               aggressive treatment of RP-ILD due to anti-MDA5 JDM, there was
               no improvement of respiratory failure in the following days and
               patient developed refractory septic shock and died. Anti-MDA5
               JDM patients with RP-ILD have a poor prognosis with a high
               mortality rate. For this reason, intensive immunosuppressive
               therapy is essential including the use of promising drugs such
               as tofacitinib. COVID-19 in children with underlying health
               conditions like anti-MDA5 JDM may still be at risk for disease

               antiviral therapies, different combinations of broad-spectrum
               antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine and plasma transfusion.
               Unfortunately, cancer patients are at higher risk of viral

               study. SETTING: 46 centres across the UK between 16 March and 4
               July 2020. A weekly online questionnaire based on the
               International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections
               Consortium-WHO Case Report Form was used to collect participant
               reported data on symptoms, test results, National Health Service
               attendance, hospital admission and impact on daily life.
               PARTICIPANTS: 1490 immunocompromised children, defined as those
               requiring an annual influenza vaccination due to their
               underlying condition or medication. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
               Incidence of SARS-CoV-2-like symptoms and patient/parent anxiety
               score. RESULTS: Over 16 weeks during the first wave of the
               pandemic, no SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed in this large
               immunocompromised paediatric cohort (median age 11 years, 54.4\%
               female). 110 symptomatic participants underwent a test for
               SARS-CoV-2; all were negative. 922 (67.4\%) participants
               reported at least one symptom consistent with suspected
               SARS-CoV-2 infection over the study period. 476 (34.8\%)
               reported three or more symptoms. The most frequently reported
               symptoms included joint pain, fatigue, headache, nausea and
               muscle pain. SARS-CoV-2 testing during this period was performed
               on admitted patients only. 137 participants had their medication
               suspended or changed during the study period due to assumed
               COVID-19 disease risk. 62\% reported high levels of anxiety
               (scores of 7-10 out of 10) at the start of the study, with
               anxiety levels remaining high throughout the study period.
               CONCLUSIONS: Although symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection
               in children were common, there were no positive tests in this
               large immunocompromised cohort. Symptom-based screening to
               facilitate early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be
               helpful in these individuals. Patient/parent anxiety about
               SARS-CoV-2 infection was high. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

               malignancies (HM). Thanks to the accelerated development of
               anti-SARS-SoV-2 vaccines in less than a year since the start of
               the global pandemic, patients with cancer were quickly
               prioritised in early 2021 for vaccination, however dependent on
               the very unequal availability at the global level. Impaired
               immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in immunocompromised
               patients was rapidly reported as early as April 2021, although
               the vaccination fortunately appears to be generally effective
               without increasing the spacing. Worryingly, the humoral response
               of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is, however, considered
               insufficient in patients followed for HM, in particular when

               caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2) has led to dramatic economic and health burdens.
               Although the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign has
               begun, exploration of other vaccine candidates is needed due to
               uncertainties with the current approved vaccines, such as
               durability of protection, cross-protection against variant
               strains, and costs of long-term production and storage. In this
               study, we developed a methyltransferase-defective recombinant
               vesicular stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
               candidate. We generated mtdVSVs expressing SARS-CoV-2
               full-length spike (S) protein, S1, or its receptor-binding
               domain (RBD). All of these recombinant viruses grew to high
               titers in mammalian cells despite high attenuation in cell
               culture. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its truncations were
               highly expressed by the mtdVSV vector. These mtdVSV-based
               vaccine candidates were completely attenuated in both
               immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these
               constructs, mtdVSV-S induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific
               neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and Th1-biased T-cell immune
               responses in mice. In Syrian golden hamsters, the serum levels
               of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs triggered by mtdVSV-S were higher
               than the levels of NAbs in convalescent plasma from recovered
               COVID-19 patients. In addition, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S
               were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung
               and nasal turbinate tissues, cytokine storm, and lung pathology.
               Collectively, our data demonstrate that mtdVSV expressing
               SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine
               candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Viral mRNA
               cap methyltransferase (MTase) is essential for mRNA stability,
               protein translation, and innate immune evasion. Thus, viral mRNA
               cap MTase activity is an excellent target for development of
               live attenuated or live vectored vaccine candidates. Here, we
               developed a panel of MTase-defective recombinant vesicular
               stomatitis virus (mtdVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates
               expressing full-length S, S1, or several versions of the RBD.
               These mtdVSV-based vaccine candidates grew to high titers in
               cell culture and were completely attenuated in both
               immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Among these vaccine
               candidates, mtdVSV-S induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific
               neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) and Th1-biased immune responses
               in mice. Syrian golden hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S
               triggered SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs at higher levels than those
               in convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients.
               Furthermore, hamsters immunized with mtdVSV-S were completely
               protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Thus, mtdVSV is a safe
               and highly effective vector to deliver SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.",

              that there are not well-established recommendations to address
              the broader risks to these workers and their families.
              Particularly vulnerable households include dual health care
              professional households, single-parent health care professional
              households, and households with health care professionals
              responsible for a high-risk family member (i.e., an older adult
              or immunocompromised person). While the demographics of these
              households are heterogeneous, it is expected that the
              professional and personal concerns specific to COVID-19 will be
              similar. These concerns include family safety, balancing
              full-time work with home-based schooling for children, the
              looming threat of illness to 1 or both partners, the potential of
              infecting high-risk family members, and the challenges of
              planning for the future during uncertain times. To elucidate
              these concerns in their department, the authors sought input from
              colleagues in dual health care professional households through an
              open-ended email communication. Respondents expressed a range of
              concerns centered on balancing professional and family
              responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
              commentary, the authors propose several recommendations in the
              areas of support networks, leadership and culture, and operations
              and logistics that health care institutions can adopt to minimize
              the burden on these vulnerable households during states of
              emergency. The successful implementation of these recommendations
              hinges on creating a work environment in which all health care

              Moderna) effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19-associated
              hospitalizations was assessed among adults aged $\geq$18 years.
              Among 3,089 hospitalized adults (including 1,194 COVID-19
              case-patients and 1,895 non-COVID-19 control-patients), the

              receipt of the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA
              COVID-19 vaccines $\geq$14 days before illness onset), with a
              median interval of 65 days (range = 14-166 days) after receipt of

               spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
               Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) forced the World Health Organization
               to declare an international state of emergency. Although best
               known for causing symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection
               in mild cases and fulminant pneumonia in severe disease,
               Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has also been associated
               with gastrointestinal, neurologic, cardiac, and hematologic
               presentations. Despite concerns over poor specificity and undue
               radiation exposure, chest imaging nonetheless remains central to
               the initial diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 progression, as
               well as to the evaluation of complications. Classic features on
               chest CT include ground-glass and reticular opacities with or
               without superimposed consolidations, frequently presenting in a
               bilateral, peripheral, and posterior distribution. More
               recently, studies conducted with MRI have shown excellent
               concordance with chest CT in visualizing typical features of
               COVID-19 pneumonia. For patients in whom exposure to ionizing
               radiation should be avoided, particularly pregnant patients and
               children, pulmonary MRI may represent a suitable alternative to
               chest CT. Although PET imaging is not typically considered among
               first-line investigative modalities for the diagnosis of lower
               respiratory tract infections, numerous reports have noted
               incidental localization of radiotracer in parenchymal regions of
               COVID-19-associated pulmonary lesions. These findings are
               consistent with data from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV
               cohorts which suggested an ability for 18F-FDG PET to detect
               subclinical infection and lymphadenitis in subjects without
               overt clinical signs of infection. Though highly sensitive, use
               of PET/CT for primary detection of COVID-19 is constrained by
               poor specificity, as well as considerations of cost, radiation
               burden, and prolonged exposure times for imaging staff. Even
               still, decontamination of scanner bays is a time-consuming
               process, and proper ventilation of scanner suites may
               additionally require up to an hour of downtime to allow for
               sufficient air exchange. Yet, in patients who require nuclear
               medicine investigations for other clinical indications, PET
               imaging may yield the earliest detection of nascent infection in
               otherwise asymptomatic individuals. Especially for patients with
               concomitant malignancies and other states of immunocompromise,
               prompt recognition of infection and early initiation of
               supportive care is crucial to maximizing outcomes and improving

               included mild to moderate injection site and systemic reactions
               (3). CDC developed v-safe, a voluntary, smartphone-based safety
               surveillance system, to provide information on adverse reactions
               after COVID-19 vaccination. Coincident with authorization of an
               additional dose for persons with immunocompromising conditions,
               the v-safe platform was updated to allow registrants to enter
               information about additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine received.
               During August 12-September 19, 2021, a total of 22,191 v-safe
               registrants reported receipt of an additional dose of COVID-19
               vaccine. Most (97.6\%) reported a primary 2-dose mRNA
               vaccination series followed by a third dose of the same vaccine.
               Among those who completed a health check-in survey for all 3
               doses (12,591; 58.1\%), 79.4\% and 74.1\% reported local or

               hospitalisation, have a high risk of several complications such
               as opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections. Mucormycosis
               is a rare and opportunistic fungal infection that mainly affects
               diabetic and immunocompromised patients. An increase has been
               observed in the number of rhino-orbital mucormycosis in patients
               with COVID-19 admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital, Kermanshah,
               Iran, since October 2020. This is a report of the frequency,
               risk factors, clinical manifestations, treatment and prognosis
               of COVID-19 associated with mucormycosis infection. METHODS: The
               medical records of COVID-19 patients with rhino-orbital
               mucormycosis who were diagnosed in an educational therapeutic
               hospital in Kermanshah, west of Iran were surveyed. Several
               parameters were analysed including demographic, clinical,
               therapeutic and laboratory characteristics. RESULTS: Twelve
               patients with COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital mucormycosis
               were identified from 12 October to 18 November 2020. All cases
               reported as proven mucormycosis had a history of hospitalisation
               due to COVID-19. Comorbidities mainly included diabetes mellitus
               (83.33\%) and hypertension (58.33\%). Seventy-five per cent of
               patients received corticosteroids for COVID- 19 treatment. The
               sites of involvement were rhino-sino-orbital (83\%) and
               rhino-sino (17\%). Amphotericin B/liposomal amphotericin B alone
               or in combination with surgical debridement or orbital
               exenteration was used as the first-line therapy. The overall
               mortality rate was 66.7\% (8/12). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high
               incidence of mucormycosis among COVID-19 patients. Diabetes
               mellitus and corticosteroid use were the dominant predisposing
               factor of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is a life-threatening and
               opportunistic infection; therefore, physicians should know the

               retrospective cohort of 58 SOT recipients with first-wave
               COVID-19, comparing patients with severe and nonsevere illness.
               Additionally, SOT recipients are compared with general patients
               with first-wave COVID-19. RESULTS: Organs transplanted included
               38 kidneys, 8 livers, 5 hearts, and 3 pancreases. Average SOT
               recipient age was 57.4 years; 62\% were male; 46.6\% were
               African American 36.2\% were white. Comorbidities included
               hypertension (86\%), chronic kidney disease (86\%), diabetes
               mellitus (50\%), coronary artery disease (26\%), and chronic
               obstructive pulmonary disease (14\%). Twenty patients had severe
               COVID-19 (34.5\%) and 38 had nonsevere disease (65.5\%). Severe
               disease was more common in older SOT recipients with
               comorbidities and was associated with cough, dyspnea, pneumonia,
               C-reactive protein >10 mg/L, and platelet count <150/$\mu$L.
               Sex, race, body mass index, time from transplant, baseline
               immunosuppression, and diagnosis month did not differ among
               those with severe and nonsevere COVID-19. Seventy percent of SOT
               recipients were hospitalized vs 27.2\% of general patients with
               COVID-19 and inpatient SOT recipients had a higher mechanical
               ventilation rate. Though a trend toward longer length of stay,
               higher intensive care unit admission, and greater inpatient
               mortality was observed (19.5\% vs 14.8\%), these differences
               were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The severe acute respiratory
               syndrome coronavirus 2 has greatly impacted SOT recipients.
               One-third of our SOT recipients seen during the first wave had
               severe illness with associated standard risk factors for poor

               is urgent to exert adequate efforts for the management of
               dialysis patients, caregivers, and healthcare personnel (HCP).
               This study aimed at reporting practical workflow, identification
               of high-risk or suspected cases of CO-VID-19, and subsequent
               response measures. METHODS: At the time of the COVID-19
               outbreak, precautions and practice protocols were applied in our
               dialysis units (DUs). This single-center study retrospectively
               reviewed all high-risk/suspected cases from January 23, 2020, to
               February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical feature, and
               detailed data on all cases were recorded. RESULTS: Practical
               workflow for the clinical management of dialysis patients,
               caregivers, and HCP was initiated. A total of 6
               high-risk/suspected cases were identified. Female gender, older
               age, presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anuresis,
               immunocompromised status, hypoalbuminemia, and underweight were
               noticeable features in these cases. Direct evidence of infection
               or epidemiological risk was detected in five cases. Close
               monitoring for temperature and oxygen saturation during
               hemodialysis sessions may be reasonable. No confirmed COVID-19
               cases were reported in our DU, but certain cases showed rapid
               deterioration due to other critically severe condition needing
               hospitalization. Portable dialysis machines are of great need to
               ensure dialysis care provision. CONCLUSIONS: Our study described
               a practical workflow for patient-centered management during
               COVID-19 outbreak. Potential risk factors and underlying
               clinical patterns were reported. Further studies regarding the

               foremost requirement has been to identify a treatment regimen
               that not only fights the causative agent but also controls the
               associated complications of the infection. Due to the
               time-consuming process of drug discovery, physicians have used
               readily available drugs and therapies for treatment of
               infections to minimize the death toll. OBJECTIVE: The aim of
               this study is to provide a snapshot analysis of the major drugs
               used in a cohort of 1562 Pakistani patients during the period
               from May to July 2020, when the first wave of COVID-19 peaked in
               Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was
               performed to provide an overview of the major drugs used in a
               cohort of 1562 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the four major
               tertiary-care hospitals in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad region of
               Pakistan during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in the
               country (May-July 2020). RESULTS: Antibiotics were the most
               common choice out of all the therapies employed, and they were
               used as first line of treatment for COVID-19. Azithromycin was
               the most prescribed drug for treatment. No monthly trend was
               observed in the choice of antibiotics, and these drugs appeared
               to be a random but favored choice throughout the months of the
               study. It was also noted that even antibiotics used for
               multidrug resistant infections were prescribed irrespective of
               the severity or progression of the infection. The results of the
               analysis are alarming, as this approach may lead to antibiotic
               resistance and complications in immunocompromised patients with
               COVID-19. A total of 1562 patients (1064 male, 68.1\%, and 498
               female, 31.9\%) with a mean age of 47.35 years (SD 17.03) were
               included in the study. The highest frequency of patient
               hospitalizations occurred in June (846/1562, 54.2\%).

               syndrome coronavirus 2) infection is associated with various
               complications. PMA (primary meningococcal arthritis) is a rare
               meningococcus-associated disease causing arthritis of the knee
               usually, without any signs of invasive meningococcal disease. No
               case of PMA in a COVID-19 (coronavirus disease, 2019) patient
               has yet been described. PMA mainly strikes young adults. PMA is
               not associated with any immunocompromising condition. It has a
               better outcome than usual septic arthritis Case presentation
               Herein, we report an 18-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19,
               later admitted with persistent fever, right knee arthralgia and
               maculopapular rash. Due to family history, psoriasis and
               Henoch-Sch{\"o}nlein purpura were hypothesized and ruled out.
               Finally, synovial fluid culture confirmed Neisseria meningitidis
               serogroup B arthritis without any other symptoms of invasive
               meningococcal disease. Healing was achieved quickly with surgery
               and antibiotics. We concluded in a PMA. Conclusion We describe
               here the first primary meningococcal arthritis in a COVID-19
               patient and we hope to shine a light on this rare but serious
               complication.",

               vaccines have shown high effectiveness in the prevention of
               symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, severe disease and death.
               Nevertheless, a minority of vaccinated individuals might become
               infected and experience significant morbidity. Characteristics
               of vaccine breakthrough infections have not been studied. We
               sought to portray the population of Israeli patients, who were
               hospitalized with COVID-19 despite full vaccination. METHODS: A
               retrospective multicentre cohort study of 17 hospitals included
               patients fully vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2
               vaccine who developed COVID-19 more than 7 days after the second
               vaccine dose and required hospitalization. The risk for poor
               outcome, defined as a composite of mechanical ventilation or
               death, was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were
               included, accounting for half of hospitalized fully vaccinated
               patients in Israel. Poor outcome was noted in 38 patients and
               mortality rate reached 22\% (34/152). Notably, the cohort was
               characterized by a high rate of co-morbidities predisposing to
               severe COVID-19, including hypertension (108; 71\%), diabetes
               (73; 48\%), congestive heart failure (41; 27\%), chronic kidney
               and lung diseases (37; 24\% each), dementia (29; 19\%) and
               cancer (36; 24\%), and only six (4\%) had no co-morbidities.
               Sixty (40\%) of the patients were immunocompromised. Higher
               viral load was associated with a significant risk for poor
               outcome. Risk also appeared higher in patients receiving
               anti-CD20 treatment and in patients with low titres of
               anti-Spike IgG, but these differences did not reach statistical
               significance. CONCLUSIONS: We found that severe COVID-19
               infection, associated with a high mortality rate, might develop
               in a minority of fully vaccinated individuals with multiple
               co-morbidities. Our patients had a higher rate of co-morbidities
               and immunosuppression compared with previously reported
               non-vaccinated hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. Further
               characterization of this vulnerable population may help to
               develop guidance to augment their protection, either by
               continued social distancing, or by additional active or passive
               vaccinations.",

               patients with COVID-19 have been reported, mostly due to
               Aspergillus spp., with anecdotic reports of Pneumocystis

               patients. We describe the first case of PJP in an
               immunocompetent patient who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia.
               CASE DESCRIPTION: Our patient was hospitalized for 18 d for
               respiratory failure due to Severe Acute Respiratory
               Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia and successfully
               treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
               respiratory support, enoxaparin, ceftaroline and intravenous 6
               mg of dexamethasone for 10 d, then with oral prednisone
               tapering. Despite his improved radiological and clinical
               conditions at discharge, he was admitted again after 18 d for
               worsening of respiratory conditions. Upon the second admission,
               a high-resolution CT-scan of the chest showed the development of
               new ground-glass opacities and P. jirovecii was detected on
               bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A therapy with
               trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole 20 mg/kg and methylprednisolone
               40 mg i.v. bis in die (BID) was started, with improvement of
               clinical, biochemical and radiological conditions. CONCLUSIONS:
               COVID-19 patients may have multiple risk factors for development
               of PJP, in particular lymphopaenia and use of steroids. PJP must
               be ruled out with direct microbiological methods in patients
               presenting with radiologic and clinical features of possible or

               caused by SARS-CoV-2 and assess the coexistence of bacterial
               respiratory tract infection during admission. METHODS:
               Retrospective observational study that included hospitalized
               adults with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 from 15/03 to
               15/05/2020. We excluded immunocompromised patients, nursing home
               residents and those admitted in the previous 14 days for another
               reasons. Analysis of ROC curves was performed, calculating the
               area under the curve for the different scales, as well as
               sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. RESULTS: A total
               of 208 patients were enrolled, aged 63$\pm$17 years, 57,7\% were
               men; 38 patients were admitted to ICU (23,5\%), of these
               patients 33 required invasive mechanical ventilation (86,8\%),
               with an overall mortality of 12,5\%. Area under the ROC curves
               for mortality of the scores were: PSI 0,82 (95\% CI: 0,73-0,91),
               CURB-65 0,82 (0,73-0,91), MuLBSTA 0,72 (0,62-0,81) and
               COVID-GRAM 0,86 (0,70-1). Area under the curve for needing

               bacterial co-infections of the respiratory tract were 20
               (9,6\%), the most frequent strains being Pseudomonas aeruginosa
               and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the
               COVID-GRAM score was the most accurate to identify patients with
               higher mortality with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2; however,

               infectious disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus
               SARS-coronavirus 2 (CoV-2). To combat the devastating spread of
               SARS-CoV-2, extraordinary efforts from numerous laboratories
               have focused on the development of effective and safe vaccines.
               Traditional live-attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines are
               not recommended for immunocompromised patients as the attenuated
               virus can still cause disease via phenotypic or genotypic
               reversion. Subunit vaccines require repeated dosing and adjuvant
               use to be effective, and DNA vaccines exhibit lower immune
               responses. mRNA vaccines can be highly unstable under
               physiological conditions. On the contrary, naturally antigenic
               viral vectors with well-characterized structure and safety
               profile serve as among the most effective gene carriers to
               provoke immune response via heterologous gene transfer. Viral
               vector-based vaccines induce both an effective cellular immune
               response and a humoral immune response owing to their natural
               adjuvant properties via transduction of immune cells.
               Consequently, viral vectored vaccines carrying the SARS-CoV-2
               spike protein have recently been generated and successfully used
               to activate cytotoxic T cells and develop a neutralizing
               antibody response. Recent progress in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with
               an emphasis on gene therapy viral vector-based vaccine
               development, is discussed in this review.",

               oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the United States (U.S.),
               initially in clinical trials, but potentially for widespread and
               repeated use. We explore logistical challenges related to U.S.
               OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to
               nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model
               the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs
               of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans
               would exceed \$4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the
               entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable
               cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, with young
               Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the
               U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV-related
               viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised
               individuals with B-cell related primary immunodeficiencies that
               could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a
               currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer
               OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would
               require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact
               polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no
               role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to
               responding to COVID-19. Countries that currently use OPV
               experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits
               than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on
               sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV
               coverage in OPV-using countries, and effective global OPV

               general populations. After a median follow-up of 23 days, 96
               patients (86.5\%) were admitted to hospital and 22 patients
               (19.8\%) required respiratory support. A total of 12 patients
               were admitted to the ICU (10.8\%). The mortality rate was 18\%,
               which was lower than in the matched general population (SMR =
               95.5 [95\% CI 94.2-96.8]). Overall, 35 patients (31.5\%) met
               criteria of severe COVID-19. Baseline immunosuppression
               containing mycophenolate was an independent predictor of severe
               COVID-19 (relative risk = 3.94; 95\% CI 1.59-9.74; p = 0.003),
               particularly at doses higher than 1,000 mg/day (p = 0.003). This
               deleterious effect was not observed with calcineurin inhibitors
               or everolimus and complete immunosuppression withdrawal showed
               no benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Being chronically immunosuppressed,
               liver transplant patients have an increased risk of acquiring
               COVID-19 but their mortality rates are lower than the matched
               general population. Upon hospital admission, mycophenolate dose
               reduction or withdrawal could help in preventing severe
               COVID-19. However, complete immunosuppression withdrawal should
               be discouraged. LAY SUMMARY: In liver transplant patients,
               chronic immunosuppression increases the risk of acquiring
               COVID-19 but it could reduce disease severity. Complete
               immunosuppression withdrawal may not be justified. However,
               mycophenolate withdrawal or temporary conversion to calcineurin
               inhibitors or everolimus until disease resolution could be
               beneficial in hospitalised patients.",

               COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we explored COVID-19 testing
               and the impact of the pandemic among participants from the Miami
               Adult Studies on HIV cohort, predominantly composed of
               low-income minorities living with and without HIV. METHODS:
               Between July and August 2020, a telephone survey was
               administered to 299 Miami Adult Studies on HIV participants to
               assess COVID-19 testing, prevention behaviors, and psychosocial
               stressors. Health care utilization, antiretroviral adherence,
               food insecurity, and substance use during the pandemic were
               compared with those of their last cohort visit (7.8 $\pm$ 2.9
               months earlier). RESULTS: Half of surveyed participants had been
               tested for COVID-19, 8 had tested positive and 2 had been
               hospitalized. PLWH (n = 183) were 42\% times less likely than
               HIV-uninfected participants to have been tested. However, after
               adjustment for age, employment, COVID-19 symptoms, mental health
               care, and substance use, the effect of HIV status was no longer
               significant. PLWH were more likely to have seen a health care
               provider, use face coverings, and avoid public transportation
               and less likely to be food insecure and drink hazardously. There
               were significant changes in substance use patterns during the
               pandemic when compared with those before. CONCLUSION: PLWH,
               compared with their HIV-uninfected peers, were more likely to
               engage in preventive measures and health care during the
               pandemic, potentially reducing their exposure to COVID-19. There
               were no reported changes in antiretroviral adherence or health
               care utilization, but there were changes in substance use; these
               need to be monitored as this crisis progresses.",

               Observational cohort study. SETTING: A total of 258 adult
               critical care units. PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with
               confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care
               between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were
               eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care
               less than 24 hr or missing core variables). MEASUREMENTS AND
               MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within
               30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible
               patients (median age 60 yr, 70\% male), 3,933 died within 30
               days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189
               patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446
               were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between
               0.1\% and 7.2\% of patients across prognostic factors. We
               imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional
               specification and continuous variables were modeled using
               restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate
               prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start
               of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple
               variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant
               associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation,
               body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest
               systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory
               rate, Pao2/Fio2 ratio (and interaction with mechanical
               ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum
               urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of
               critical care. Nonsignificant associations were found for sex,
               sedation, highest temperature, and lowest hemoglobin
               concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient
               characteristics that predict an increased likelihood of death
               within 30 days of the start of critical care for patients with
               coronavirus disease 2019. These findings may support development
               of a prediction model for benchmarking critical care providers.",

               recipients vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine and
               monitored for adverse events following both doses, the

               treatments or vaccines to date for COVID-19. Guidance measures

  abstract  = "Respiratory infections caused by viruses such as influenza and
               coronavirus are a serious global problem due to their high
               infection rates and potential to spark pandemics, such as the
               current COVID-19 pandemic. Although preventing these infections
               by using vaccines has been the most successful strategy to date,
               effective vaccines are not always available. Therefore,
               developing broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs to treat such
               infections is essential, especially in the case of
               immunocompromised patients or for outbreaks of novel virus
               strains. Sialic acids have been highlighted as a key molecule in
               the viral infection cycle, with terminally sialylated glycans
               acting as a target for several viral proteins involved in
               infection, particularly respiratory infection. Inhibitors of one
               such protein, neuraminidase, are the only anti-influenza drugs
               currently on the market. Problems with neuraminidase inhibitors,
               including the development of resistance and a relatively narrow
               spectrum of activity, drive the need for an improved
               understanding of the viral infection cycle and the development
               of more resilient, broader-spectrum anti-viral treatments.
               Hence, this review outlines the various roles played by sialic
               acids in respiratory viral infection and provides examples of
               drugs that exploit sialic acids to inhibit viral infections. It
               has been concluded that drugs targeting host cell expression of
               sialic acid could be especially well suited to inhibiting a
               broad spectrum of respiratory infections. This warrants the
               continued design and improvement of such drugs in an attempt to
               lessen the burden of respiratory infections.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In almost all lower and lower middle-income
              countries, the healthcare system is structured in the customary
              model of in-person or face to face model of care. With the
              current global COVID-19 pandemics, the usual health care service
              has been significantly altered in many aspects. Given the fragile
              health system and high number of immunocompromised populations in
              lower and lower-middle income countries, the economic impacts of
              COVID-19 are anticipated to be worse. In such scenarios,
              technological solutions like, Telemedicine which is defined as
              the delivery of healthcare service remotely using
              telecommunication technologies for exchange of medical
              information, diagnosis, consultation and treatment is critical.
              The aim of this study was to assess healthcare providers'
              acceptance and preferred modality of telemedicine and factors
              thereof among health professionals working in Ethiopia. METHODS:
              A multi-centric online survey was conducted via social media
              platforms such as telegram channels, Facebook groups/pages and
              email during Jul 1- Sep 21, 2020. The questionnaire was adopted
              from previously validated model in low income setting. Internal
              consistency of items was assessed using Cronbach alpha
              ($\alpha$), composite reliability (CR) and average variance
              extracted (AVE) to evaluate both discriminant and convergent
              validity of constructs. The extent of relationship among
              variables were evaluated by Structural equation modeling (SEM)
              using SPSS Amos version 23. RESULTS: From the expected 423
              responses, 319 (75.4\%) participants responded to the survey
              questionnaire during the data collection period. The majority of
              participants were male (78.1\%), age <30 (76.8\%) and had less
              than five years of work experience (78.1\%). The structural model
              result confirmed the hypothesis ``self-efficacy has a significant
              positive effect on effort expectancy'' with a standardized
              coefficient estimate ($\beta$) of 0.76 and p-value <0.001. The
              result also indicated that self-efficacy, effort expectancy,
              performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and social
              influence have a significant direct effect on user's attitude
              toward using telemedicine. User's behavioral intention to use
              telemedicine was also influenced by effort expectancy and
              attitude. The model also ruled out that performance expectancy,
              facilitating conditions and social influence does not directly
              influence user's intention to use telemedicine. The squared
              multiple correlations (r2) value indicated that 57.1\% of the
              variance in attitude toward using telemedicine and 63.6\% of the
              variance in behavioral intention to use telemedicine is explained
              by the current structural model. CONCLUSION: This study found
              that effort expectancy and attitude were significantly predictors
              of healthcare professionals' acceptance of telemedicine. Attitude
              toward using telemedicine systems was also highly influenced by
              performance expectancy, self-efficacy and facilitating
              conditions. effort expectancy and attitude were also significant
              mediators in predicting users' acceptance of telemedicine. In
              addition, mHealth approach was the most preferred modality of
              telemedicine and this opens an opportunity to integrate
              telemedicine systems in the health system during and post
              pandemic health services in low-income countries.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: During the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic,
               rapidly rising disease prevalence in the United States created a
               demand for patient-facing information exchanges that addressed
               questions and concerns about the disease. One approach to
               managing increased patient volumes during a pandemic involves
               the implementation of telephone-based triage systems. During a
               pandemic, telephone triage hotlines can be employed in
               innovative ways to conserve medical resources and offer useful
               population-level data about disease symptomatology and risk
               factor profiles. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe
               and evaluate the COVID-19 telephone triage hotline used by a
               large academic medical center in the midwestern United States.
               METHODS: Michigan Medicine established a telephone hotline to
               triage inbound patient calls related to COVID-19. For calls
               received between March 24, 2020, and May 5, 2020, we described
               total call volume, data reported by callers including COVID-19
               risk factors and symptomatology, and distribution of callers to
               triage algorithm endpoints. We also described symptomatology
               reported by callers who were directed to the institutional
               patient portal (online medical visit questionnaire). RESULTS: A
               total of 3929 calls (average 91 calls per day) were received by
               the call center during the study period. The maximum total
               number of daily calls peaked at 211 on March 24, 2020. Call
               volumes were the highest from 6 AM to 11 AM and during evening
               hours. Callers were most often directed to the online patient
               portal (1654/3929, 42\%), nursing hotlines (1338/3929, 34\%), or
               employee health services (709/3929, 18\%). Cough (126/370 of
               callers, 34\%), shortness of breath (101/370, 27\%), upper
               respiratory infection (28/111, 25\%), and fever (89/370, 24\%)
               were the most commonly reported symptoms. Immunocompromised
               state (23/370, 6\%) and age >65 years (18/370, 5\%) were the

               the object of current debate. Accumulating evidence suggest that
               treatment with high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) may
               be effective in this characteristic clinical scenario. Case
               report: A 52-years old immunocompromised female patient,
               previously treated with rituximab for low grade B-cell lymphoma,
               showed prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding and a long-term course of
               signs of severe COVID-19. A first cycle of treatment with
               remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug effective in
               inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication, did not provide fully and
               sustained clinical remission. A second hospitalization was
               deemed necessary after 10 days from the first hospital discharge
               due to recrudescence of symptoms of severe COVID-19 and the
               evidence of bilateral interstitial pneumonia at the chest-CT
               scan. Clinical and radiological findings completely disappeared
               after CCP administration. The viral culture confirmed the
               absence of SARS-CoV-2-related cytopathic effect. The clinical
               evaluation, performed two months after hospital discharge, was
               unremarkable. Results: Findings from our case report suggest
               that the host T-cell specific response to SARS-CoV-2 is not
               sufficient to reduce viral load in the absence of neutralizing
               antibodies. Acquired immune antibodies and/or related components
               passively infused with CCP might help in boosting the plasma
               recipient response to the virus and promoting complete viral
               clearance. Conclusions: Independently from negative results in
               immunocompetent individuals, the potential effectiveness of CCP
               infusion in selected cohorts of patients with primary or
               secondary impaired immune response should be tested. Further
               research about mechanisms of host response in immunocompromised
               patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is required.",

               cross-sectional study, we studied 82 hospital workers with IMD
               (mean age: 42.2 $\pm$ 10.0 years) and 300 (mean age: 41.7 $\pm$
               9.9 years) controls. Among + 65 aged population, we studied 22
               (mean age: 71.4 $\pm$ 4.5 years) patients and 47 controls (mean
               age: 70.9 $\pm$ 4.8 years). All study subjects had a negative
               history for COVID-19. Sera were obtained after at least 21 days
               following the second vaccination. Anti-spike IgG antibody titers
               were measured quantitatively using a commercially available
               immunoassay method. RESULTS: Patients with IMD were
               significantly less likely to have detectable antibodies than
               healthy controls both among the hospital workers (92.7\% vs
               99.7\%, p < 0.001) and elderly population (77.3\% vs 97.9\%, p =
               0.011). Among patients with IMD, those using immunosuppressive
               or immune-modulating drugs (64/75, 85.3\%) were significantly
               less likely to have detectable antibodies compared to those off
               treatment (29/29, 100\%) (p = 0.029). Additionally, a negative
               association between age and the antibody titer categories among
               patients (r = - 0.352; p < 0.001) and controls (r = - 0.258; p <
               0.001) were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospital workers,
               the vast majority of patients with IMD and immunocompetent
               controls developed a significant humoral response following the
               administration of the second dose of inactivated COVID-19
               vaccine. This was also true for the elderly population, albeit
               with lower antibody titers. Immunosuppressive use, particularly
               rituximab significantly reduced antibody titers. Antibody titers
               were significantly lower among those aged $\geq$ 60 years both
               in patient and control populations. Whether these individuals
               should get a booster dose warrants further studies.",

               and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP
               style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE:
               While COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization (EUA) deemed
               the vaccines to be effective and safe for public use, the phase
               3 trials leading to EUA predominantly excluded patients with
               immunocompromising conditions. Immunocompromised patients make
               up a significant proportion of the population, and in light of
               recent mass vaccination efforts, we aim to review current
               evidence and recommendations of COVID-19 vaccines in 4 patient
               populations with immunocompromising disorders or conditions:
               human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, solid organ
               transplantation, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel
               disease. SUMMARY: Given the evolving data on safety and efficacy
               of the approved COVID-19 vaccines in the immunocompromised
               population, it is vital that pharmacists and other immunizing
               providers understand the current data and recommendations and
               provide the public with accurate information. To date, the only
               immunocompromised subgroup included in phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine
               trials have been those with HIV infection. However, recent
               retrospective trials have provided reassuring safety data of the
               COVID-19 vaccine in immunocompromised patients, and the interim
               analysis of the Moderna phase 3 trial produced promising
               efficacy data on HIV-infected patients. Presently, the US
               Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, British Society for
               Immunology, and various other governmental and professional
               societies and organizations endorse COVID-19 vaccination in the
               immunocompromised population. CONCLUSION: While additional data
               is warranted to determine the effects of immunocompromising
               medical conditions and immunosuppressing medications on the
               efficacy of the vaccine, the benefits of the vaccine is
               anticipated to outweigh theoretical risks. Thus, the COVID-19
               vaccine is recommended to be given to immunocompromised patients
               at this time, and providers should make efforts to decrease
               vaccine hesitancy in this population through education and
               reassurance.",

               COVID-19 due to immunosuppression and respiratory tropism of
               SARS-CoV-2. The information on the effect of COVID-19 mRNA
               vaccines to elicit immunogenic responses after a two-dose (2D)
               regimen in LT recipients is sparse. Thus, we assessed the effect
               of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines' 2D regimen on
               anti-spike responses in immunocompromised LT recipients.
               METHODS: We utilized serum samples from LT recipients vaccinated
               for SARS-CoV-2 with 2D of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna
               vaccines and 2D-vaccinated na{\"\i}ve (non-transplanted and
               non-exposed to COVID-19) group. Antibody responses were assessed
               using the FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG
               assay (IgGNC), the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgM assay
               (IgMSP), and the SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein IgG II assay
               (IgGSP). CD4+ T-cell activity was assessed as a marker of immune
               competence using the ImmuKnow\textregistered{} assay. RESULTS:
               About 25\% (18/73) of SARS-CoV-2 uninfected-LT patients
               generated a positive spike-IgG response following 2D of
               vaccines, with 36\% (9/25) in the Moderna cohort and only 19\%
               (9/48) in the Pfizer cohort. 2D in LT patients elicited a
               significantly lesser median IgGSP response (1.7 AU/mL, 95\% CI:
               0.6-7.5 AU/mL) compared to non-transplanted, uninfected
               na{\"\i}ve subjects (14,209 AU/mL, 95\% CI: 11,261-18,836 AU/mL;
               p < 0.0001). In LT patients, the Moderna-evoked seropositivity
               trend was higher than Pfizer. CONCLUSION: 2D COVID-19
               vaccination elicits a dampened serological response in LT
               patients. Whether assessing other arms of host immunity combined

              caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cancer patients are usually
              immunocompromised and thus are particularly susceptible to
              SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in COVID-19. Although many
              vaccines against COVID-19 are being preclinically or clinically
              tested or approved, none have yet been specifically developed for
              cancer patients or reported as having potential dual functions to
              prevent COVID-19 and treat cancer. Here, we confirmed that
              COVID-19 patients with cancer have low levels of antibodies
              against the spike (S) protein, a viral surface protein mediating
              the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, compared with COVID-19
              patients without cancer. We developed an oncolytic herpes simplex
              virus-1 vector-based vaccine named oncolytic virus (OV)-spike.
              OV-spike induced abundant anti-S protein neutralization
              antibodies in both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice, which
              inhibit infection of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and wild-type (WT) live
              SARS-CoV-2 as well as the B.1.1.7 variant in vitro. In the
              tumor-bearing mice, OV-spike also inhibited tumor growth, leading
              to better survival in multiple preclinical tumor models than the
              untreated control. Furthermore, OV-spike induced anti-tumor
              immune response and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response without
              causing serious adverse events. Thus, OV-spike is a promising

               proteins for patient stratification with different grades of
               illness severity. Patients and Methods: Peripheral blood samples
               from 43 patients with different grades of COVID-19, 7 MERS-CoV
               patients admitted to the ICU, and 10 healthy subjects were
               analyzed using label-free quantitative liquid
               chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results: We identified
               193 and 91 proteins that differed significantly between COVID-19
               and MERS-CoV sample groups, respectively, and 49 overlapped
               between datasets. Only 10 proteins are diagnostic of
               asymptomatic cases, 12 are prognostic of recovery from severe
               illness, and 28 are prognostic of a fatal outcome of COVID-19.
               These proteins are implicated in virus-specific/related
               signaling networks. Notable among the top canonical pathways are
               humoral immunity, inflammation, acute-phase response signaling,
               liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation,
               coagulation, and the complement system. Furthermore, we
               confirmed positive viral shedding in 11.76\% of 51 additional

              raises concern for viral evolution. Methods: Amplification of
              sub-genomic transcripts for the E gene (sgE) was done on
              nasopharyngeal samples over the course of 355 days in a patient
              infected with SARS-CoV-2 who had previously undergone CAR T cell
              therapy and had persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal
              swabs. Whole genome sequencing was performed on samples from the
              patient's original presentation and 10 months later. Results:
              Over the course of almost a year, the virus accumulated a unique
              in-frame deletion in the amino-terminal domain of the spike
              protein, and complete deletion of ORF7b and ORF8, the first

              minority variants that were identified in the early
              samples-reflecting the heterogeneity of the initial
              infection-were found to be fixed late in the infection.
              Remdesivir and high-titer convalescent plasma treatment were
              given, and the infection was eventually cleared after 335 days of

              protracted SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in immunosuppressed

              open-label, randomised trial. Patients are included if adult
              admitted to intensive care unit for a CAP. Diagnosis of pneumonia
              is based on clinical criteria and a newly appeared parenchymal
              infiltrate. Immunocompromised patients are excluded. Subjects are
              randomised (1:1 ratio) to either the intervention arm
              (experimental strategy) or the control arm (usual strategy). In
              the intervention arm, the microbiological diagnosis combines a
              respiratory multiplex PCR (mPCR) and conventional microbiological
              investigations. An algorithm of early antibiotic de-escalation or
              discontinuation is recommended, based on mPCR results and the
              procalcitonin value. In the control arm, only conventional
              microbiological investigations are performed and antibiotics
              de-escalation remains at the clinician's discretion. The primary
              endpoint is the number of days alive without any antibiotic from
              the randomisation to day 28. Based on our hypothesis of 2 days
              gain in the intervention arm, we aim to enrol a total of 450
              patients over a 30-month period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The
              MULTI-CAP trial is conducted according to the principles of the

               for mitigating the devastating health and economic impacts
               resulting from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related
               public health orders. Recent case reports of reactions to
               COVID-19 vaccines have raised questions about their safety for
               use in individuals with allergies and those who are
               immunocompromised. In this document, we aim to address these
               concerns and provide guidance for allergists/immunologists.
               METHODS: Scoping review of the literature regarding COVID-19
               vaccination, adverse or allergic reactions, and immunocompromise
               from PubMed over the term of December 2020 to present date. We
               filtered our search with the terms ``human'' and ``English'' and
               limited the search to the relevant subject age range with the
               term ``adult.'' Reports resulting from these searches and
               relevant references cited in those reports were reviewed and
               cited on the basis of their relevance. RESULTS: Assessment by an
               allergist is warranted in any individual with a suspected
               allergy to a COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components.
               Assessment by an allergist is NOT required for individuals with
               a history of unrelated allergies, including to allergies to
               foods, drugs, insect venom or environmental allergens. COVID-19
               vaccines should be offered to immunocompromised patients if the
               benefit is deemed to outweigh any potential risks of
               vaccination. INTERPRETATION: This review provides the first
               Canadian guidance regarding assessment of an adolescent and
               adult with a suspected allergy to one of the COVID-19 vaccines
               currently available, or any of their known allergenic
               components, and for patients who are immunocompromised who
               require vaccination for COVID-19. As information is updated this

               and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus).
               SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type
               2) causes COVID-19. On January 30, 2020, the World Health
               Organization (WHO) announced that the current outbreak of
               COVID-19 is the sixth global health emergency. As of December 3,
               2020, 64 million people worldwide have been affected by this
               malaise, and the global economy has experienced a loss of more
               than \$1 trillion. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense
               single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Betacoronavirus
               genus. The high nucleotide sequence identity of SARS-CoV-2 with
               the BatCoV RaTG13 genome has indicated that bats could be the
               possible host of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the host cell
               via binding its spike protein to the angiotensin-converting
               enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is similar to the mechanisms of
               SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. COVID-19 can spread from person to person
               via respiratory droplets and airborne and contaminated fomites.
               Moreover, it poses a significant risk to smokers, the elderly,
               immunocompromised people, and those with preexisting
               comorbidities. Two main approaches are used to control viral
               infections, namely, vaccination, and biosecurity. Studies to
               analyze the antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2
               vaccine candidates are underway, and few vaccines may be
               available in the near future. In the current situation, the
               Human Biosecurity Emergency (HBE) may be the only way to cope
               effectively with the novel SARS-CoV-2 strain. Here, we summarize
               current knowledge on the origin of COVID-19 as well as its
               epidemiological relationship with humans and animals, genomic
               resemblance, immunopathogenesis, clinical-laboratory signs,
               diagnosis, control and prevention, and treatment. Moreover, we
               discuss the interventional effects of various nutrients on
               COVID-19 in detail. However, multiple possibilities are explored
               to fight COVID-19, and the greatest efforts targeted toward
               finding an effective vaccine in the near future. Furthermore,
               antioxidants, polyphenols, and flavonoids, both synthetic and
               natural, could play a crucial role in the fight against
               COVID-19.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The advised standard treatment for bacterial brain
               abscess following surgery is 6 to 8 weeks of intravenous (IV)
               antibiotic treatment, but an early switch to oral antibiotic
               treatment has been suggested to be equally effective. METHODS:
               This investigator-initiated, international, multi-center,
               parallel group, open-label, randomized (1:1 allocation)
               controlled trial will examine if oral treatment after 2 weeks of
               IV antibiotic therapy is non-inferior to standard 6-8 weeks of
               IV antibiotics for bacterial brain abscess in adults ($\geq$ 18
               years of age). The study will be conducted at hospitals across
               Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Australia, and Sweden.
               Exclusion criteria are severe immunocompromise or impaired
               gastro-intestinal absorption, pregnancy, device-related brain
               abscesses, and brain abscess caused by nocardia, tuberculosis,
               or Pseudomonas spp. The primary objective is a composite
               endpoint at 6 months after randomization consisting of all-cause
               mortality, intraventricular rupture of brain abscess, unplanned
               re-aspiration or excision of brain abscess, relapse, or
               recurrence. The primary endpoint will be adjudicated by an
               independent blinded endpoint committee. Secondary outcomes
               include extended Glasgow Outcome Scale scores and all-cause
               mortality at end of treatment as well as 3, 6, and 12 months
               since randomization, completion of assigned treatment, IV
               catheter associated complications, durations of admission and
               antibiotic treatment, severe adverse events, quality of life
               scores, and cognitive evaluations. The planned sample size is
               450 patients for a one-sided alpha of 0.025 and a power of 90\%
               to exclude a difference in favor of standard treatment of more
               than 10\%. Date of initiation of first study center was November
               3, 2020, with active recruitment for 3 years and follow-up for 1
               year of all patients. DISCUSSION: The results of this study may
               guide future recommendations for treatment of bacterial brain
               abscess. If early transition to oral antibiotics proves
               non-inferior to standard IV treatment, this will provide
               considerable health and costs benefits. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

               as SARS-CoV-2 evolves into numerous variants. Since the first
               identification of the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC)
               Omicron on November 24th , 2021, from an immunocompromised
               patient in South Africa, the variant has overtaken Delta as the
               predominant lineage in South Africa and has quickly spread to
               over 40 countries. Here we provide an initial molecular
               characterization of the Omicron variant through analyzing the
               large number of mutations especially in the spike protein
               receptor-binding domain (RBD) with their potential effects on
               viral infectivity and host immunity. Our analysis indicates that
               the Omicron variant has two subclades and may evolve from clade
               20B instead of the currently dominant Delta variant. In
               addition, we have also identified mutations that may affect the
               ACE2 receptor and/or antibody bindings. Our study has raised
               additional questions on the evolution, transmission, virulence,

               formation in patients with an auto-immune disease or
               immunodeficiency is not fully unraveled yet. It could be
               hypothesized that immunodeficient patients, due to
               immunosuppressive drugs or their disease, have a more severe
               disease course due to their immunocompromised state. However, it
               could also be hypothesized that some of the immunosuppressive
               drugs protect against a hyperinflammatory state. Methods: We
               collected data on the incidence of COVID-19, disease course and
               SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in COVID-19 positive patients in a
               cohort of patients (n ​= ​4497) known at the Clinical Immunology
               outpatient clinic in a tertiary care hospital in the
               Netherlands. Results: In the first six months of the pandemic,
               16 patients were identified with COVID-19, 14 by nasal swab PCR,
               and 2 patients by SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Eight patients were
               admitted to the hospital. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured in

               Antibody production for SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised patients

               includes individuals with solid organ transplantation on

               53-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department (ED)
               with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias. She was found to
               test positive for COVID-19. Her relevant medical history
               included liver transplantation on chronic immunosuppression.
               More recently, she had tested positive for COVID-19
               approximately three months prior to this and was hospitalized at
               that time for encephalopathy and treated with remdesivir and
               convalescent plasma. She had subsequently recovered with
               negative COVID-19 testing in the interim. On the ED presentation
               with presumed re-infection, her disease was deemed to be mild
               with lack of severe symptoms or pulmonary involvement, and she
               was discharged with outpatient follow-up for monoclonal antibody

               disease observed in our patient. On the other hand, a less
               robust immune response may decrease humoral immunity and leave
               patients at greater risk of re-infection. Further investigation

               SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage in vaccinated SOT recipients.
               METHODS: Three SOT patients were hospitalized in the Policlinico
               Hospital of Bari (southern Italy) and underwent nasopharyngeal
               swabs for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes and spike
               protein mutations by real-time PCR. One sample was subjected to
               whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: One patient was a heart
               transplant recipient and two were kidney transplant recipients.
               All were hospitalized with severe COVID-19 between March and May
               2021. Two patients were fully vaccinated and one had received
               only one dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All the patients
               showed a high viral load at diagnosis, and molecular typing
               revealed the presence of B.1.1.7 lineage SARS-CoV-2. In all
               three cases, prolonged viral shedding was reported. CONCLUSIONS:
               The three cases pose concern about the role of the B.1.1.7
               lineage in severe COVID-19 and about the efficacy of COVID-19
               vaccination in immunocompromised patients. Protecting
               immunocompromised patients from COVID-19 is a challenge. SOT
               recipients show a suboptimal response to standard vaccination,
               and thus, an additive booster or a combined vaccination strategy
               with mRNA, protein/subunit, and vector-based vaccines may be
               necessary. This population should continue to practice strict

               review article summarizes seven case series and reports totaling
               46 patients. While one case report suggested that sarcoidosis
               medications such as glucocorticoids may lengthen the COVID-19
               disease course, another study with a larger registry suggests
               they do not. More studies are needed to elucidate an improvement
               in outcomes. It is possible that addition of TNF-alpha
               inhibitors at COVID-19 diagnosis decreases hospitalization rate.
               Overall, it is difficult to make firm conclusions regarding
               treatment given the heterogeneity of treatment modalities in the

               with underlying conditions, we assessed duration of coronavirus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, reverse-transcription
               polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity, and culture
               positivity among nursing home residents. Methods: We enrolled
               residents within 15 days of their first positive SARS-CoV-2 test
               (diagnosis) at an Arkansas facility from July 7 to 15, 2020 and
               instead them for 42 days. Every 3 days for 21 days and then
               weekly, we assessed COVID-19 symptoms, collected specimens
               (oropharyngeal, anterior nares, and saliva), and reviewed
               medical charts. Blood for serology was collected on days 0, 6,
               12, 21, and 42. Infectivity was defined by positive culture.
               Duration of culture positivity was compared with duration of
               COVID-19 symptoms and RT-PCR positivity. Data were summarized
               using measures of central tendency, frequencies, and
               proportions. Results: We enrolled 17 of 39 (44\%) eligible
               residents. Median participant age was 82 years (range, 58-97
               years). All had $\geq$3 underlying conditions. Median duration
               of RT-PCR positivity was 22 days (interquartile range [IQR],
               8-31 days) from diagnosis; median duration of symptoms was 42
               days (IQR, 28-49 days). Of 9 (53\%) participants with any
               culture-positive specimens, 1 (11\%) severely immunocompromised
               participant remained culture-positive 19 days from diagnosis; 8
               of 9 (89\%) were culture-positive $\leq$8 days from diagnosis.
               Seroconversion occurred in 12 of 12 (100\%) surviving
               participants with $\geq$1 blood specimen; all participants were
               culture-negative before seroconversion. Conclusions: Duration of
               infectivity was considerably shorter than duration of symptoms

               described as a multisystem disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and it
               can cause acute liver injury or decompensation of the

               COVID-19 in the last few months. The pathogenesis of liver
               involvement in COVID-19 includes viral cytotoxicity, the

               often immunocompromised, making them more susceptible to
               infections. Since COVID-19 frequently causes respiratory

               high-risk group. Genes that have been indicated to mediate viral

               (SARS-CoV-2) is a promising therapeutic modality for the

               least a century to provide passive immunity against a number of
               diseases, and was recently proposed by the World Health
               Organization for human Ebola virus infection. Only a few small
               studies have so far been published on patients with COVID-19 and
               concomitant hematological malignancies (HM). The Italian
               Hematology Alliance on HM and COVID-19 has found that HM
               patients with COVID-19 clinically perform more poorly than those
               with either HM or COVID-19 alone. A COVID-19 infection in
               patients with B-cell lymphoma is associated with impaired
               generation of neutralizing antibody titers and lowered clearance
               of SARS-CoV-2. Treatment with CP was seen to increase antibody
               titers in all patients and to improve clinical response in 80\%
               of patients examined. However, a recent study has reported
               impaired production of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in an
               immunosuppressed individual treated with CP, possibly supporting
               the notion of virus escape, particularly in immunocompromised
               individuals where prolonged viral replication occurs. This may
               limit the efficacy of CP treatment in at least some HM patients.
               More recently, it has been shown that CP may provide a
               neutralising effect against B.1.1.7 and other SARS-CoV-2
               variants, thus expanding its application in clinical practice.
               More extensive studies are needed to further assess the use of

               rates of 56.1\% and 74.8\%, respectively. COVID-19 patients are
               often characterised by the presence of known risk factors for
               candidemia such as in-dwelling vascular catheters, mechanical
               ventilation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. We also describe
               3185 cases of mucormycosis (including 1549 cases of
               rhino-orbital mucormycosis (48.6\%)), for which the main risk
               factor is a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus
               (>76\%). Its diagnosis involves a histopathological examination
               of tissue biopsies, and its treatment requires anti-fungal
               therapy combined with aggressive surgical resection/debridement,
               but crude mortality rates are again high: 50.8\% in case reports
               and 16\% in observational studies. The presence of other
               secondary IFIs usually diagnosed in severely immunocompromised
               patients show that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of stunning the host
               immune system: 20 cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 5
               cases of cryptococcosis, 4 cases of histoplasmosis, 1 case of

               and management of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients
               (SOTR) has evolved tremendously since the pandemic's beginning.
               We summarize the current literature surrounding the virology of
               SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology of COVID-19 in transplant recipients,
               review the clinical features and complications of COVID-19 in
               SOTR, and discuss the safety and efficacy of current therapies
               and candidate vaccines in this population. Recent findings:
               Despite initial suspensions in organ transplantation during
               early 2020, routine donor testing and de-crowding of hospitals
               have allowed transplant activity to resume at pre-pandemic
               rates. COVID-19-associated mortality in SOTR is similar to that
               of the general population, and lower than that of patients with
               end-organ disease awaiting transplant. The optimal approach to
               immunosuppression in SOTR with COVID-19 is unknown and disease
               severity may influence management decisions. Many vaccines in
               development are likely to be safe for immunocompromised hosts,
               though post-marketing investigations will be required to
               determine the efficacy in the SOTR. Summary: Though there are
               multiple unique considerations in the care of SOTR with
               COVID-19, immunosuppression does not appear to have a
               detrimental impact on overall outcome. Organ transplantation

               merits of different forms of antiviral therapy to be assessed in
               individual patients. A stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19
               intracellular dynamics is introduced here, that incorporates
               essential steps of the viral life cycle targeted by treatment
               options. Integration of model predictions with an intercellular
               ODE model of within-host infection dynamics, fitted to patient
               data, generates a generic profile of disease progression in
               patients that have recovered in the absence of treatment. This
               is contrasted with the profiles obtained after variation of
               model parameters pertinent to the immune response, such as
               effector cell and antibody proliferation rates, mimicking
               disease progression in immunocompromised patients. These
               profiles are then compared with disease progression in the
               presence of antiviral and convalescent plasma therapy against
               COVID-19 infections. The model reveals that using both therapies
               in combination can be very effective in reducing the length of
               infection, but these synergistic effects decline with a delayed
               treatment start. Conversely, early treatment with either therapy
               alone can actually increase the duration of infection, with
               infectious virions still present after the decline of other

              summarizes COVID-19 features and outcomes in autologous and
              allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
              recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings suggest that HSCT
              recipients exhibit a high burden of comorbidities and COVID-19
              clinical features almost similar to the general COVID population.
              Furthermore, HSCT recipients exhibit a protracted SARS-CoV-2
              shedding, prolonging duration of symptoms and promoting the
              generation of highly mutated viruses. Last, most of studies
              report a higher COVID-19 mortality in HSCT recipients, mainly
              driven by age, comorbidities, time from transplantation, and
              immunosuppression because of both treatments and underlying
              hematological malignancy. SUMMARY: Further studies are warranted
              to determine the proper impact of HSCT-related immune disorders
              on COVID-19 outcomes, and to evaluate specific treatments and
              vaccination strategy in this high-risk population. Taken
              together, those findings emphasize the need for more rigorous
              surveillance and preemptive measures for all HSCT recipients.",

              swabs in the 96 hours following hospital admission were negative,
              despite a CT thorax suggestive for an early stage of infection.
              COVID-infection was finally confirmed in the bronchoalveolar
              lavage (BAL) fluid, performed for exclusion of an alternative
              diagnosis in immunocompromised. In the BAL an increased
              cellularity with marked lymphocytosis of 35\%, a reduced CD4/CD8
              ratio of 0.1 and borderline neutrophilia of 3\% were found. This
              finding might be due to the concomitant therapy with anti-CD20
              antibodies, but the presence of lymphocytosis in the BAL despite
              peripheral lymphopenia with decreased CD4/CD8 T-cells ratio are
              described here for the first time in a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
              Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea), fever and
              initially headache were the predominant symptoms. The respiratory
              symptoms were scarce (variable mild dyspnea mMRC1). The
              respiratory conditions worsened during the hospital stay, with
              tachypnea up to 35/min, increased need for supplemental oxygen up
              to 8 L/min and worsening lung infiltrates on CT thorax on day 5.
              A therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an

              respiratory improvement, without need for intensive care or any
              ventilator support, and hospital discharge on day 16. Our case
              highlights some diagnostic and therapeutical challenges occurring
              in patients with COVID-19 infection. As take-home message, in the
              presence of clinical and radiological findings compatible with
              SARS-CoV-2 infection we outline the importance of treating
              patients accordingly, also in presence of repeated negative

               are a high priority for clinical intervention. In this review,
               we summarize how COVID-19 has thus far impacted the management
               of TNBC and highlighted where more information is needed to hone
               shifting guidelines. Due to the immunocompromised state of most

               pandemic presents challenges beyond the constraints of

               search of treatment recommendations for both primary and
               targeted TNBC therapeutic strategies during the COVID-19
               outbreak and noted changes to treatment timing and drugs of
               choice. Further, given that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus,
               which has systemic consequences, management of TNBC patients
               with metastatic versus localized disease has additional
               considerations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Published dataset
               gene expression analysis of critical SARS-CoV-2 cell entry
               proteins in TNBCs suggests that the virus could in theory infect
               metastasized TNBC cells it contacts. This may have unforeseen
               consequences in terms of both the dynamics of the resulting
               acute viral infection and the progression of the chronic
               metastatic disease. Undoubtedly, the results thus far suggest

               allograft are at high risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2. It has
               been shown that the development of potent neutralizing humoral
               immunity against SARS CoV-2 leads to an increased probability of
               survival. However, the question of whether immunocompromised
               patients develop antibodies has not yet been sufficiently
               investigated; (2) Methods: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were examined
               in hemodialysis patients on the waiting list for kidney
               transplantation as well as patients after kidney
               transplantation. Patients were interviewed about symptoms and
               comorbidities, BMI, and smoking history; (3) Results: SARS-CoV-2
               antibodies were found in 16 out of 259 patients (6\%). The trend
               of infections here reflects the general course of infection in
               Germany with a peak in November/December of 2020. Remarkably,
               patients on the waiting list experienced only mild disease. In
               contrast, transplanted patients had to be hospitalized but
               recovered rapidly from COVID-19. Most interesting is that all
               immunosuppressed patients developed antibodies against
               SARS-CoV-2 after infection; (4) Conclusions: Even with extensive
               hygiene concepts, an above-average number of patients were
               infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the second wave of infections in
               Germany. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the formation of
               antibodies even in these immunocompromised patients, we expect
               vaccination to be effective in this group of patients. Thus,
               dialysis patients and patients after kidney transplantation
               should be given high priority in vaccination programs.",

               protective anti-spike antibodies after vaccination (608 IU/mL),

               weeks following his second vaccination with mRNA-1273. Results:
               Sequencing of the viral isolate revealed an extensively mutated
               variant with 10 spike protein mutations, including E484Q and

               Multiple myeloma patients who do develop detectable antibody
               responses to vaccination may be at increased risk for

               1527 participants from 46 hospitals. Cross-sectional serology
               was investigated in February and March 2021. RESULTS: Until the

               concern with new challenges emerging as the pandemic progresses.
               The recent rise of opportunistic infections especially
               mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients is further complicating their
               outcomes. Mucormycosis is well known to infect patients with
               diabetes mellitus, malignancy, chemotherapy, and other
               immunocompromised conditions. The treatment of COVID-19 largely
               remains systemic steroids and other immunomodulators that add to
               the risk of invasive fungal infection. METHODOLOGY: Here, we
               present a retrospective case series of 13 patients with
               individual clinical characteristics along with the demography
               and treatment details. The data were collected retrospectively
               in a single center that caters to a large population of COVID-19
               patients with varying severity. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were
               presented with COVID-19 associated mucormycosis (CAM). The
               median age was higher in non-survivors (49.5 years), with a
               higher odds of death (23.8) in those with severe COVID, having
               overall mortality of 64.3\%. Moreover, diabetes mellitus was
               present in 61.5\% of patients with a mortality of 75\%. About 11
               (84.6\%) patients had received prior steroids for COVID-19. The
               incidence of hyperglycemia at admission was equal among both
               survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of
               mucormycosis seems to be increasing among COVID-19 patients
               which may be associated with increased use of steroids, the
               possible immunocompromised state imposed by SARS-CoV-2, or
               co-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus. The mortality
               of CAM is remarkably high and apart from preventive practices
               and rational use of immunomodulators, a high index of suspicion
               with early diagnosis would be key to survival.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: International guidelines recommend pneumococcal
               pneumonia and influenza vaccination for all patients with solid
               organ malignancies prior to initiating chemotherapy. Baseline
               vaccination rates (March 2019) for pneumococcal pneumonia and
               influenza at our tertiary cancer centre were 8\% and 40\%,
               respectively. The aim of this study was to increase the number
               of gynecologic chemotherapy patients receiving pneumococcal and
               influenza vaccinations to 80\% by March 2020. METHODS: We
               performed an interrupted time series study using structured
               quality improvement methodology. Three interventions were
               introduced to address vaccination barriers: an in-house
               vaccination program, a staff education campaign, and a patient
               care bundle (pre-printed prescription, information brochure,
               vaccine record booklet). Process and outcome data were collected
               by patient survey and pharmacy audit and analyzed on statistical
               process control charts. RESULTS: We identified 195 eligible
               patients. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates rose
               significantly from 5\% to a monthly mean of 61\% and from 36\%
               to a monthly mean of 67\%, respectively. The 80\% target was
               reached for both vaccines during one or more months of study.
               The in-house vaccination and staff education programs were major
               contributors to the improvement, whereas the information
               brochure and record booklet were minor contributors.
               CONCLUSIONS: Three interventions to promote pneumococcal and
               influenza vaccination among chemotherapy patients resulted in
               significantly improved vaccination rates. Lessons learned about
               promoting vaccine uptake may be generalizable to different
               populations and vaccine types. In response to the global

              long-term myocardial injury due to off-target effects. Besides,
              cancer patients and survivors are severely immunocompromised due
              to the harsh effect of anti-cancer therapy targeting the bone
              marrow cells. Cancer patients and survivors can therefore be
              potentially extremely clinically vulnerable and at risk from
              infectious diseases. The recent global outbreak of the novel
              coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2) and its infection called coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19) has rapidly become a worldwide health emergency, and
              on March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by the
              World Health Organization (WHO). A high fatality rate has been
              reported in COVID-19 patients suffering from underlying
              cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the critical and crucial
              aspect of monitoring cancer patients and survivors for potential
              cardiovascular complications during this unprecedented health
              crisis involving the progressive worldwide spread of COVID-19.
              COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease; however, COVID-19
              has shown cardiac injury symptoms similar to the cardiotoxicity
              associated with anti-cancer therapy, including arrhythmia,
              myocardial injury and infarction, and heart failure. Due to the
              significant prevalence of micro- and macro-emboli and damaged
              vessels, clinicians worldwide have begun to consider whether
              COVID-19 may in fact be as much a vascular disease as a
              respiratory disease. However, the underlying mechanisms and
              pathways facilitating the COVID-19-induced cardiac injury in
              cancer and non-cancer patients remain unclear. Investigations
              into whether COVID-19 cardiac injury and anti-cancer drug-induced
              cardiac injury in cancer patients and survivors might
              synergistically increase the cardiovascular complications and
              comorbidity risk through a ``two-hit'' model are needed.
              Identification of cardiac injury mechanisms and pathways
              associated with COVID-19 development overlapping with anti-cancer
              therapy could help clinicians to allow a more optimized prognosis
              and treatment of cancer survivors suffering from COVID-19. The
              following review will focus on summarizing the harmful
              cardiovascular risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients and survivors
              treated with an anti-cancer drug. This review will improve the

               is designed at clarifying the concepts on how the findings of
               Aspergillus spp. in COVID-19 patients were interpreted. We
               searched Medline to identify the studies on Aspergillus spp.
               findings in COVID-19 patients. Included were observational
               studies containing the following information: explicit mention
               of the total number of the study population, study period,
               reason for obtaining respiratory samples, case definition, and
               clinical outcomes. Excluded were case series, case reports and
               reviews. Identified were 123 publications, and 8 observational
               studies were included. From the included studies the following
               issues were identified. The proportion of immunocompromised
               patients considered as host factors varied from 0 to 17\%. Most
               of the studies did not mention radiographic findings explicitly.
               Respiratory samples were mostly obtained to investigate clinical
               deterioration. Aspergillus culture, antigen or PCR testing on
               bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed in between
               23.3\% and 66.3\% of the study population. Two studies performed
               periodic samples of BAL. Galactomannan index (GI) positivity in
               BAL was between 10\% and 28\%. GI in blood was found in 0.9\% to
               6.7\% of the available samples. The prevalence of
               COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis ranged from 2.7\% to
               27.7\%. Studies compared the mortality between defined cases and
               non-cases, and all showed increased mortality in cases. No
               studies showed that antifungal treatment reduced mortality.
               Concluding, this review showed how studies defined the clinical
               entity COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis where
               positive Aspergillus test in the respiratory sample was the main
               driver for the diagnosis. There were many differences between
               studies in terms of test algorithm and Aspergillus test used
               that largely determined the prevalence. Whether antifungal
               therapy, either as prophylaxis, pre-emptive or targeted therapy
               will lead to better outcomes of COVID-19-associated pulmonary
               aspergillosis patients is still need to be answered.",

               coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for coronavirus
               disease 2019 (COVID-19), which in males, especially in advanced
               age, can sometimes evolve into acute respiratory distress
               syndrome. In addition, mild to moderate alterations in liver
               function tests (LFTs) have been reported in the worst affected
               patients. Our review aims to analyse data on the incidence and
               prognostic value of LFT alterations, the underlying mechanisms
               and the management of pre-existing liver disease in COVID-19
               affected patients. Methods: We searched available literature
               through online PubMed database using terms as ``SARS-CoV-2,''
               ``Liver damage,'' ``Liver Function tests,'' ``COVID-19,''
               ``pre-existing liver disease,'' ``drug-induced liver injury.''
               Results: Available evidence suggest that there could be a
               relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and liver damage,
               although the underlying involved mechanism remains unclear.
               Cohort studies have shown that high ALT levels, low platelet
               counts and low albumin levels at admission and during
               hospitalisation are associated with a high mortality rate.
               Unfortunately, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on
               pre-existing liver damage. While chronic viral infections or
               NAFLD are associated with an increased risk of COVID-19
               progression, patients with cirrhosis may have increased
               susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their systemic
               immunocompromised status. DILI seems common among hospitalised
               patient with severe pneumonia. Conclusion: Mild to moderate
               liver impairment during Covid-19 is common, especially in
               patients with pre-existing liver disease. Further studies should
               be performed in order to understand how pre-existing liver
               conditions may influence and worsen progression of liver disease

               against SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed,
               Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and guideline databases.
               REVIEW METHODS: Guideline search strategies, supplemented by
               database searches on sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL),
               idiopathic facial nerve paralysis (Bell's palsy), sinonasal
               polyposis, laryngotracheal disorders, head and neck oncology,
               and pediatric otolaryngology, prioritizing systematic reviews,
               randomized controlled trials, and COVID-19-specific findings.
               CONCLUSIONS: Systemic corticosteroids (SCSs) reduce long-term
               morbidity in individuals with SSNHL and Bell's palsy, reduce
               acute laryngotracheal edema, and have benefit in perioperative
               management for some procedures. Topical or locally injected
               corticosteroids are preferable for most other otolaryngologic
               indications. SCSs have not shown long-term benefit for sinonasal
               disorders. SCSs are not a contraindication to vaccination with
               COVID-19 vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug
               Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
               noted that these vaccines are safe for immunocompromised
               patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: SCS use for SSNHL, Bell's
               palsy, laryngotracheal edema, and perioperative care should
               follow prepandemic standards. Local or topical corticosteroids
               are preferable for most other otolaryngologic indications.
               Whether SCSs attenuate response to vaccination against COVID-19
               or increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown.
               Immunosuppression may lower vaccine efficacy, so
               immunocompromised patients should adhere to recommended
               infection control practices. COVID-19 vaccination with
               Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Johnson \& Johnson vaccines is safe

              of SARS-CoV-2 within immunocompromised hosts could serve as a
              reservoir for mutation accumulation and subsequent emergence of
              novel strains with the potential to evade immune responses.
              Methods: We describe three patients with acute lymphoblastic
              leukemia who were persistently positive for SARS-CoV-2 by
              real-time polymerase chain reaction. Viral viability from
              longitudinally-collected specimens was assessed. Whole-genome
              sequencing and serological studies were performed to measure
              viral evolution and evidence of immune escape. Findings: We found
              compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up
              to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA,
              single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results
              reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses,
              and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune
              escape. Interpretation: Our results highlight the need to
              reassess infection control precautions in the management and care
              of immunocompromised patients. Routine surveillance of mutations
              and evaluation of their potential impact on viral transmission

               significantly reduced immunologic responses to COVID-19
               vaccines. The immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine/infection in
               patients with solid tumors is reduced. We evaluated the
               immunologic response to COVID-19 and/or the BNT162b2 mRNA
               COVID-19 vaccine among cancer patients on active treatments and
               reviewed previous literature to identify subgroups that may
               require third vaccination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2
               S1/S2 antibodies were measured in a cohort of 202 cancer
               patients on active treatment with chemotherapy (96), immunologic
               (52), biologic (46), and hormonal (12) treatments for early (n =
               66, 32.7\%) or metastatic disease (n = 136, 67.3\%). Of those,
               172 had received two vaccine doses, and 30 had COVID-19
               infection (20/30 also received one dose of vaccine). Specific
               anti-S receptor-binding domain antibodies were further measured
               in patients with equivocal anti-S1/S2 results. RESULTS: Among
               cancer patients, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response rate was
               89.1\% (180/202) after COVID-19 vaccination or infection and
               87.2\% (150/172) in patients after vaccination without a history
               of COVID-19, compared with 100\% positive serologic tests in a
               control group of 30 health care workers (P 60 AU/ml) was more
               likely with immunotherapy (odds ratio 2.44) and less likely with
               chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both
               COVID-19 vaccine and natural infection are highly immunogenic
               among cancer patients. Our study, however, identifies those
               under chemotherapy as significantly less responsive, and with
               lower antibody levels. These findings justify close virological
               and serological surveillance along with consideration of these
               patients for booster (third dose) vaccine prioritization, as new
               highly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge.",

              in immunocompromised hosts. On the other hand, clinical studies
              have clarified that the COVID-19 clinical burden is mostly due to
              over-inflammation and immune-mediated multiorgan injury. This has
              led to downsizing the role of immunosuppression as a determinant
              of outcome, and early reports confirm the hypothesis that
              patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatments do not have an
              increased risk of severe COVID-19 with respect to the general
              population. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 natural reservoirs, such as
              bats and mice, have evolved mechanisms of tolerance involving
              selection of genes optimizing viral clearance through interferon
              type I and III responses and also dampening inflammasome response
              and cytokine expression. Children exhibit resistance to COVID-19
              severe manifestations, and age-related features in innate and
              adaptive response possibly explaining this difference are
              discussed. A competent recognition by the innate immune system
              and controlled pro-inflammatory signaling seem to be the pillars
              of an effective response and the premise for pathogen clearance
              in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunosuppression-if not associated with
              other elements of fragility-do not represent per se an obstacle
              to this competent/tolerant phenotype in children. Several reports
              confirm that children receiving immunosuppressive medications
              have similar clinical involvement and outcomes as the pediatric
              general population, indicating that maintenance treatments should
              not be interrupted in suspect or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

               illness from COVID-19. We report a case of a 27-week-gestation
               extremely premature infant born to a mother with COVID-19
               infection. The infant, initially treated for surfactant

               the fifth day of life requiring escalating ventilatory support,
               an elevated level of C-reactive protein, thrombocytopenia, and
               an elevated level of d-dimer. The infant was positive for
               SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from Day 1 to Day 42 of his life. The
               infant responded to a seven-day course of dexamethasone with a

               of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

               there are concerns about dampened immune responses to COVID-19
               vaccination among immunocompromised patients, including people
               living with HIV (PLWH), which may blunt the vaccine's efficacy
               and durability of protection. This study aimed to assess the
               qualitative SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity among PLWH after
               vaccination. METHODS: We conducted targeted COVID-19 vaccination
               (all received BNT162b2 vaccine) of PLWH (aged $\geq$ 55 years
               per state guidelines) at Yale New Haven Health System and
               established a longitudinal survey to assess their qualitative
               antibody responses at 3 weeks after the first vaccination (and
               prior to receipt of the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine)
               (visit 1) and at 2-3 weeks after the second vaccination (visit
               2) but excluded patients with prior COVID-19 infection. Our goal
               was to assess vaccine-induced immunity in the population we
               studied. Qualitative immunogenicity testing was performed using
               Healgen COVID-19 anti-Spike IgG/IgM rapid testing. Poisson
               regression with robust standard errors was used to determine
               factors associated with a positive IgG response. RESULTS: At
               visit 1, 45 of 78 subjects (57.7\%) tested positive for
               SARS-CoV-2 anti-Spike IgG after the first dose of COVID-19
               vaccine. Thirty-nine subjects returned for visit 2. Of these, 38
               had positive IgG (97.5\%), including 20 of 21 subjects (95.2\%)

               been less likely to seroconvert after the first dose of the
               COVID-19 vaccine. The direction of these associations was
               similar in the multivariate model, although none of these
               findings reached statistical significance (RRintegrase inhibitor

               longitudinal immune profiling of a transplant recipient
               hospitalized twice for COVID-19. METHODS: A 66-year-old male
               renal transplant recipient was hospitalized with COVID-19 March
               2020 then readmitted to the hospital with COVID-19 233 days
               after initial diagnosis. Virologic and immunologic investigation
               were performed on samples from the primary and secondary
               infections. RESULTS: Whole viral genome sequencing and
               phylogenic analysis revealed that viruses causing both
               infections were caused by distinct genetic lineages without
               evidence of immune escape mutations. Longitudinal comparison of
               cellular and humoral responses during primary SARS-CoV-2
               infection revealed that this patient responded to the primary
               infection with low neutralization titer anti-SARS-CoV-2
               antibodies that were likely present at the time of reinfection.
               DISCUSSION: The development of neutralizing antibodies and
               humoral memory responses in this patient failed to confer
               protection against reinfection, suggesting that they were below
               a neutralizing titer threshold or that additional factors may be
               required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.
               Development of poorly neutralizing antibodies may have been due
               to profound and relatively specific reduction in na{\"\i}ve CD4
               T-cell pools. Seropositivity alone may not be a perfect
               correlate of protection in immunocompromised patients.",

               with multiple myeloma are at increased risk for infection and
               generally have poorer responses to vaccines. In this study, we
               examined antibody responses after complete COVID-19 vaccination
               in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, most of whom were
               receiving treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real world study of
               consecutive patients with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell
               dyscrasias (PCD) were evaluated after complete vaccination with
               either the 2-shot mRNA vaccines from BioNTech and Moderna or the
               1-shot adenoviral vector vaccine from Johnson \& Johnson (J\&J).
               Patients received vaccines 1-4 months before antibody testing
               without controlling for the type of vaccine or the timing of
               drug therapy. Patients with a clinical history or antibody
               evidence of prior infection were excluded. Antinucleocapsid and
               quantitative anti-spike antibody levels were measured with the
               Roche Elecys assay. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent of patients had
               detectable antibody responses. Multivariate analysis showed that
               higher age, ongoing anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody therapy and
               the J\&J vaccine negatively affected quantitative response. A
               small number of ineffectively vaccinated patients receiving IVIG
               subsequently had detectable nucleocapsid and spike antibodies
               confirming the presence of the latter in currently administered
               IVIG. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all PCD had detectable anti-spike
               antibodies after vaccination but age, anti-CD38 monoclonal
               antibody therapy, and the single-shot J\&J vaccine negatively
               affected responses. In patients who received the J\&J vaccine,
               second doses or heterologous mRNA vaccines should be tested.

              transmission-based precautions for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease
              2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients has been controversial. The
              Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered reverse
              transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic test- or
              symptom-based guidelines. Methods: A retrospective chart review
              of Vidant Health system, Eastern North Carolina, was conducted.
              Length of stay, days in isolation unit, and date appropriate for
              discharge or isolation discontinuation based on the symptom-based
              strategy were recorded. Results: Of 196 COVID hospitalized
              patients, 34 had repeated COVID PCR tests 3 or more days from
              their first positive test result. Half of these patients
              experienced delays in release from transmission-based precautions
              because of repeated positive PCR test results and use of the
              test-based approach. This resulted in an additional 166 days of
              hospitalization, costing an estimated \$415,000. Furthermore, 2
              subjects had a combined 16-day delay in necessary medical
              procedures. Most of the COVID PCR platforms yield quantitative
              results in the form of cycle threshold (Ct) values, the number of
              cycles needed to detect the genome. These values have also been
              used to assess whether patients are likely to remain contagious.
              None of our patients who met the criteria for symptom-based
              strategy for transmission-based precaution discontinuation had
              positive PCR test results with Ct values lower than 25, but 4 had
              Ct values lower than 30. Conclusions: Concerns surround
              immunocompromised patients and those treated with steroids who
              might be delayed or incapable of stopping viral replication and
              thus remain contagious. Our results suggest that clinicians use
              all available data including Ct values to evaluate the safety of
              discontinuation of transmission precautions.",

               syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), risking prolonged viremia
               and symptom duration. In this study we describe clinical and
               virological treatment outcomes in a heterogeneous group of
               patients with severe immunosuppression due to various causes
               suffering from COVID-19 infection, who were all treated with
               convalescent plasma (CCP) along with standard treatment.
               METHODS: We performed an observational, retrospective case
               series between May 2020 to March 2021 at three sites in
               Sk{\aa}ne, Sweden, with a population of nearly 1.4 million
               people. All patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who received CCP
               with the indication severe immunosuppression as defined by the
               treating physician were included in the study (n = 28). RESULTS:
               In total, 28 severely immunocompromised patients, half of which
               previously had been treated with rituximab, who had received
               in-hospital convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 were
               identified. One week after CCP treatment, 13 of 28 (46\%)
               patients had improved clinically defined as a decrease of at
               least one point at the WHO-scale. Three patients had increased
               score points of whom two had died. For 12 patients, the
               WHO-scale was unchanged. CONCLUSION: As one of only few studies
               on CCP treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with
               severe immunosuppression, this study adds descriptive data. The
               study design prohibits conclusions on safety and efficacy, and
               the results should be interpreted with caution. Prospective,
               randomized trials are needed to investigate this further.",

               case series about 17 immunocompromised patients admitted to our
               respiratory department during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.
               White blood cell count, C reactive protein, interleukin 6,
               lymphocytic subpopulation count (CD4+, CD8+, CD20+) and
               immunoglobulin count (IgG, IgM, IgA) were measured at
               hospitalization. Results: the most common causes of
               immunosuppression observed in our severe COVID-19 population are
               hematological malignancies, immunosuppressant drugs for
               transplant, primary immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel
               disease. Onset symptoms were fever (88\%), cough (53\%),

               high rate. These variants include the Marseille-4 lineage
               (Nextclade 20A.EU2) in Europe, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant first
               detected in the UK, the 20H/501Y.V2 variant first detected in

               Hispanic (49 648/75 149, 66.1\%) and included slightly more
               females than males (39 736, 52.9\%), with few immunocompromised

               2.52, CI 1.23-5.17 versus <18 years), immunocompromised (HR
               2.48, CI 1.31-4.68), hospitalized (HR 1.60, CI 1.07-2.38), and

               respectively. Multivariable models were constructed with
               stepwise model-building procedures. Race/ethnicity, marital
               status, job classification, immunocompromised status, flu
               vaccination and childhood vaccination opinions independently
               predicted hesitancy scale scores. Gender, education, job
               classification and BMI independently predicted acceptance,
               hesitancy, and refusal groups. Among hesitant employees,
               uncertainty was reflected in reports of motivating factors
               influencing their indecision. Despite a strong employee-support
               environment and job protection, respondents reported physical
               and mental health effects. The appreciation of varied reasons
               for refusing vaccination should lead to culturally sensitive

               (SARS-CoV-2) variant, B.1.1.7, has recently been reported in the
               UK, causing global alarm. Most likely, the new variant emerged
               in a persistently infected patient, justifying a special focus
               on these cases. Our aim in this study was to explore certain
               clinical profiles involving severe immunosuppression that may
               help explain the prolonged persistence of viable viruses. We
               present three severely immunosuppressed cases (A, B, and C) with
               a history of lymphoma and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding (2, 4,
               and 6 months), two of whom finally died. Whole-genome sequencing
               of 9 and 10 specimens from Cases A and B revealed extensive
               within-patient acquisition of diversity, 12 and 28 new single
               nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively, which suggests ongoing
               SARS-CoV-2 replication. This diversity was not observed for Case
               C after analysing 5 sequential nasopharyngeal specimens and one
               plasma specimen, and was only observed in one bronchoaspirate
               specimen, although viral viability was still considered based on
               constant low Ct values throughout the disease and recovery of
               the virus in cell cultures. The acquired viral diversity in
               Cases A and B followed different dynamics. For Case A, new
               single nucleotide polymorphisms were quickly fixed (13-15 days)
               after emerging as minority variants, while for Case B, higher
               diversity was observed at a slower emergence: fixation pace (1-2
               months). Slower SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pace was observed for
               Case A following the administration of hyperimmune plasma. This
               work adds knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 prolonged shedding in severely
               immunocompromised patients and demonstrates viral viability,
               noteworthy acquired intra-patient diversity, and different
               SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics in persistent cases.",

               evaluated in nasopharyngeal samples at the hospital admission of
               suspected COVID-19 patients. From 173 consecutive cases, 60 were
               SARS-CoV-2 positive and 13/60 (21.7\%) were HHV-6 positive after
               identified as the HHV-6B species by a Sanger sequencing. The

               METHODS: Prospective, single-centre observational study in
               non-immunocompromised adults aged 18 years or more who received
               two doses of BNT162b2. The study contemplates analyses of serum
               samples collected 1.5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the second
               dose of BNT162b2; results of the 1.5- and 3-month time-points
               are presented in this report. Antibodies against the receptor
               binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of severe
               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (anti-RBD
               antibodies) were measured using a commercial quantitative
               immunoassay. A threshold of 4160 AU/mL (corresponding to an ID50
               of 1:250) was used as surrogate marker for serum neutralizing
               activity. RESULTS: Of 273 hospital workers who received two
               doses of BNT162b2, 260 (95\%) agreed to participate in the
               study; 2/260 (0.8\%) were excluded because of immunocompromised
               conditions. At the time of this report, 230/258 (89\%)
               participants (mean age 46.0 years (SD 11.4 years); 143/230
               (62\%) female; 87/230 (38\%) male) had completed 3 months of
               follow up after the second dose of BNT162b2. Thirty-six (16\%)
               of the 230 had documented mild SARS-CoV-2 infection before
               receiving the first dose of BNT162b2. Median (interquartile
               range (IQR)) anti-RBD titres 1.5 months after vaccination were
               9356 (5844-16 876) AU/mL; 3 months after vaccination, median
               anti-RBD titres had declined to 3952 (2190-8561) AU/mL (p <
               0.001). Of 199/230 (86.5\%) participants who had anti-RBD titres
               above 4160 AU/mL 1.5 months after the second dose of BNT162b2,
               only 95/230 (41\%) maintained anti-RBD titres above this level 3
               months after vaccination (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The decline
               of anti-RBD antibodies 3 months after the second dose of
               BNT162b2 is of concern because it raises the possibility of a
               short-lived humoral immunity after vaccination. Booster doses of
               BNT162b2 might be required to maintain high titres of anti-RBD

               vaccine for patients previously vaccinated with mRNA vaccines,
               with criteria that do not always coincide. The COVID Scientific
               Committee of the Illustrious College of Physicians of Madrid
               (ICOMEM) has received and asked several questions about this
               situation, to which the group has tried to give answers, after
               deliberation and consensus. The efficacy of the vaccines
               administered so far is beyond doubt and they have managed to
               reduce, fundamentally, the severe forms of the disease. The
               duration of this protection is not well known, is different in
               different individuals and for different variants of the virus
               and is not easily predictable with laboratory tests. Data on the
               real impact of a supplementary or ``booster'' dose in the
               scientific literature are scarce for the moment and its
               application in large populations such as those in the state of
               Israel may be associated with a decrease in the risk of new and
               severe episodes in the short observation period available. We
               also lack sufficient data on the safety and potential adverse
               effects of these supplementary doses and we do not know the
               ideal time to administer them in different situations. In this
               state of affairs, it seems prudent to administer supplemental
               doses to those exposed to a higher risk, such as
               immunocompromised individuals and the elderly. On the other
               hand, we consider that this is not the time to accelerate, on
               the spur of the moment, a massive administration of a third dose
               to other population groups that are less exposed and at lower
               risk, without waiting for adequate scientific information, which
               will undoubtedly arrive gradually. We do not believe that this
               position is incompatible with the practical and ethical warnings
               made by the World Health Organization in this respect.",

               was to characterize and compare the immune response to the virus
               in HD patients and KTR. METHODS: The study included 26 HD
               patients and 54 KTR-both convalescent (14 HD, 25 KTR) and
               unexposed. The immune response was assessed by determining the
               anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum and specific T cell response
               via the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Moreover,
               blood-morphology-derived parameters, immune cell phenotypes, and
               acute phase reactants were evaluated. RESULTS: KRT and HD
               convalescents presented similar serum levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2
               IgG and IgA. A negative correlation occurred between IgG and
               time after the infection was observed. There was a strong
               relationship between the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 cellular
               and humoral responses in both groups. Convalescent IGRA response
               was significantly higher in HD patients compared to KTR.
               CONCLUSIONS: HD patients and KTR develop humoral and cellular
               responses after COVID-19. The antibodies levels are similar in
               both groups of patients. SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell response is
               stronger in HD patients compared to KTR. The SARS-CoV-2-specific
               IgG level decreases with time while IgA and a cellular response
               are maintained. IGRA proved to be a valuable test for the

               retrospectively analyzed all patients with a P. jirovecii PCR
               performed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, tracheal aspirate, or
               sputum within a month after the COVID-19 diagnosis. Fifty-seven
               patients with COVID-19 infection were tested for P. jirovecii.
               Among 57 patients with COVID-19, four patients had a concomitant
               positive P. jirovecii PCR. These four patients were elderly with
               a mean age of 78. Two patients were immunocompromised, and the
               two others presented only diabetes mellitus. Three patients
               presented an ARDS requiring transfer to the ICU and mechanical
               ventilation. All patients presented lymphocytopenia. Three
               patients had probable PCP, and one had proven PCP. All patients
               died within two months after hospital admission. These
               co-infections are rare but severe, therefore, PCP should be

               respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The aim of this
               study was to focus on the specific T-cell response. We
               quantified S1-specific IgG, neutralizing antibody titers, total
               specific IFN$\gamma$-secreting T cells by ELISpot, and
               functionality of CD4+- and CD8+-specific T cells by flow

               immunosenescence parameters were collected at baseline in

               129 young adults (median age 44.0 years) and 105 older residents
               living in a LCTF (median age 86.5 years), 3 months after the
               first injection. Humoral and cellular memory responses were
               dramatically impaired in the COVID-19-naive older (n = 54)
               compared with the COVID-19-naive younger adults (n = 121).
               Notably, older participants' neutralizing antibodies were 10
               times lower than the younger's antibody titers (p < 0.0001) and
               LCTF residents also had an impaired functional T-cell response:
               the frequencies of IFN$\gamma$+ and
               IFN$\gamma$+IL-2+TNF$\alpha$+ cells among specific CD4+ T cells,
               and the frequency of specific CD8+ T cells were lower in
               COVID-19-naive older participants than in COVID-19-naive young
               adults (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0018, respectively). However,
               COVID-19-recovered older participants (n = 51) had greater
               antibody and T-cell responses, including IFN$\gamma$+ and
               IFN$\gamma$+IL-2+TNF$\alpha$+-specific CD4+ T cells (p <
               0.0001), as well as TNF$\alpha$+-specific CD8+ T cells (p <
               0.001), than COVID-19-naive older adults. We also observed that
               ``inflammageing'' and particularly high plasma levels of
               TNF$\alpha$ was associated to poor antibody response in the
               older participants. In conclusion, our results show that the

               CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in addition to impaired antibody

               efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines, as in other
               immunocompromised subjects. Our study also shows that, despite
               their physiological alterations of immunity, vaccination is

              Description: A 55-year-old immunocompromised female (i.e.,
              history 17 years ago of Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular sclerosis
              variant) recently developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with

              flexion/extension maneuver. The brain and cervicothoracic spine
              MRI studies documented a clival anterior spinal epidural hematoma
              with maximum spinal compression at the T1-T2 level; it also
              extended inferiorly to the T6 level. Two weeks later, the

              significant neurological improvement and almost complete pain

               respiratory symptoms needing invasive mechanical ventilation.
               The way the case was managed broke with the custom that

               should be deferred as much as possible since the chances of

               Although patients with HIV infection are immunocompromised and

               prolonged demic has spread rapidly across the globe, resulting
               in more than 3 million deaths worldwide. The symptoms of
               Covid-19 are usually mild and non-specific, however in some
               cases patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome
               (ARDS) and systemic inflammation. Individuals with inflammatory
               or immunocompromising illnesses, such as cancer, are more
               susceptible to develop ARDS and have higher rates of mortality.
               This is mediated through an initial hyperstimulated immune
               response which results in elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
               cytokines and a subsequent cytokine storm. This potentiates
               positive feedback loops which are unable to be balanced by
               anti-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, elevated levels of
               IL-1$\beta$, as a result of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as
               well as IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$ amongst many others, contribute to
               the progression of various cancer types. Furthermore, Covid-19
               progression is associated with the depletion of CD8+ and CD4+ T
               cells, B cell and natural killer cell numbers. Collectively, a

               a median of 9·0 days (IQR 5·0-20·0). Treatment included
               immunomodulation in 60 decedents and antifungals in 50

               decedents, including eight CAPA, two unspecified IMD, and one
               disseminated mucormycosis. Among 320 decedents who received
               mechanical ventilation, six (2\%) had IMD. We conclude that IMD,

               bronchiectasis exacerbation rates were decreased during the

              infections and their risk factors. Objective: To identify risk
              factors associated with COVID-19 breakthrough infections among
              vaccinated individuals and to reassess the effectiveness of
              COVID-19 vaccination against severe outcomes using real-world
              data. Design Setting and Participants: We conducted a series of
              observational retrospective analyses using the electronic health
              records (EHRs) of Columbia University Irving Medical Center/New
              York Presbyterian (CUIMC/NYP) up to September 21, 2021. New York
              adult residence with PCR test records were included in this
              analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: Poisson regression was used
              to assess the association between breakthrough infection rate in
              vaccinated individuals and multiple risk factors - including
              vaccine brand, demographics, and underlying conditions - while
              adjusting for calendar month, prior number of visits and
              observational days. Logistic regression was used to assess the
              association between vaccine administration and infection rate by
              comparing a vaccinated cohort to a historically matched cohort in
              the pre-vaccinated period. Infection incident rate was also
              compared between vaccinated individuals and longitudinally
              matched unvaccinated individuals. Cox regression was used to
              estimate the association of the vaccine and COVID-19 associated
              severe outcomes by comparing breakthrough cohort and two matched
              unvaccinated infection cohorts. Results: Individuals vaccinated
              with Pfizer/BNT162b2 (IRR against Moderna/mRNA-1273 [95\% CI]:
              1.66 [1.17 - 2.35]); were male (1.47 [1.11 - 1.94\%]); and had
              compromised immune systems (1.48 [1.09 - 2.00]) were at the
              highest risk for breakthrough infections. Vaccinated individuals
              had a significant lower infection rate among all subgroups. An
              increased incidence rate was found in both vaccines over the
              time. Among individuals infected with COVID-19, vaccination
              significantly reduced the risk of death (adj. HR: 0.20 [0.08 -
              0.49]). Conclusion and Relevance: While we found both mRNA
              vaccines were effective, Moderna/mRNA-1273 had a lower incidence
              rate of breakthrough infections. Both vaccines had increased
              incidence rates over the time. Immunocompromised individuals were
              among the highest risk groups experiencing breakthrough
              infections. Given the rapidly changing nature of the SARS-CoV-2,
              continued monitoring and a generalizable analysis pipeline are
              warranted to inform quick updates on vaccine effectiveness in
              real time. Key Points: Question: What risk factors contribute to
              COVID-19 breakthrough infections among mRNA vaccinated
              individuals? How do clinical outcomes differ between vaccinated
              but still SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and non-vaccinated,
              infected individuals?Findings: This retrospective study uses
              CUIMC/NYP EHR data up to September 21, 2021. Individuals who were
              vaccinated with Pfizer/BNT162b2, male, and had compromised immune
              systems had significantly higher incidence rate ratios of
              breakthrough infections. Comparing demographically matched
              pre-vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, vaccinated
              individuals had a lower incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection
              among all subgroups.Meaning: Leveraging real-world EHR data
              provides insight on who may optimally benefit from a booster
              COVID-19 vaccination.",

               following COVID-19 disease are widely being reported and are an
               area that should receive careful attention. Mucormycosis is a
               fatal fungal condition affecting immunocompromised patients
               caused by a group of mold mucoromycetes. Candida albicans (C.
               albicans) is an oral commensal present in almost 40-65\% of
               healthy oral cavities in adults. Several cases of mucormycosis
               and oral candidiasis have been reported lately in COVID-19
               patients, and it may elevate the associated risks of morbidity
               and mortality. Materials and Methods: Articles were taken from a
               period of 2020 to April 2021 using search sources such as
               Cochrane, PubMed, Fungiscope and Mycobank using keywords
               mucormycosis, Black fungus, oral candidiasis, white fungus,
               COVID-19, Sars-Cov-2. Discussion: The development of oral
               mucocutaneous lesions, such as mucormycosis and candidiasis in
               COVID-19 patients could be due to inhaling spores resulting in
               pulmonary and/or sinus congestion and prolonged mechanical
               ventilation in the ICU settings and the long-term use of
               broad-spectrum antibiotics respectively. The onset of
               candidiasis after the emergence of COVID-19 clinical signs and
               symptoms varied considerably and is reported within 1-30 days in
               most of the cases reported in the literature. Biofilms present
               on the denture surfaces are predisposing factors to oral
               candidiasis. We aim to summarize the limited data available
               regarding diagnosis, clinical presentation, and therapeutic
               approaches for the management of Mucormycosis and oral
               candidiasis in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: Careful monitoring
               of oral lesions should be instituted through interdisciplinary
               telemedicine and teleconsultation to aid in primary diagnosis,
               thereby avoiding personal attendance during the pandemic. Dental
               practitioners should be included among the interdisciplinary
               teams for exhaustive intraoral examination and reduce the risk

              Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019
              (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent
              plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants, though
              the current therapeutic options remain limited and expensive. The
              vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized
              for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of
              SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are
              not yet to be documented, and populations with immunocompromised
              conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient
              patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response.
              In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to
              SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for
              escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody
              therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen
              receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent
              antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse
              effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK
              cells in preventing and treating severe cases of COVID-19 has not
              yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach
              for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and
              its D614G mutant. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv
              domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and
              SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody that targets the highly
              conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, therefore
              would be more likely to recognize different variants of
              SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to
              pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G mutant. Furthermore,
              S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing
              SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity
              and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently
              published CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way
              for generating 'off-the-shelf' S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in
              high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy
              for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.",

               This group of viruses is named so as they exhibit characteristic
               crown-like spikes on their protein coat. SARS-CoV-2, a type of
               coronavirus that emerged in 2019, causes severe infection in the
               lower respiratory tract of humans and is often fatal in
               immunocompromised individuals. No medications have been approved
               so far for the direct treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the
               currently available treatment options rely on relieving the
               symptoms. The medicinal plants occurring in nature serve as a
               rich source of active ingredients that could be utilized for
               developing pharmacopeial and non-pharmacopeial/synthetic drugs

               mainly been excluded from clinical trials of vaccination against
               COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this prospective clinical trial was
               to investigate safety and efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination
               in five selected groups of immunocompromised patients and
               healthy controls. METHODS: 539 study subjects (449 patients and
               90 controls) were included. The patients had either primary
               (n=90), or secondary immunodeficiency disorders due to human
               immunodeficiency virus infection (n=90), allogeneic
               hematopoietic stem cell transplantation/CAR T cell therapy
               (n=90), solid organ transplantation (SOT) (n=89), or chronic
               lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=90). The primary endpoint was
               seroconversion rate two weeks after the second dose. The
               secondary endpoints were safety and documented SARS-CoV-2
               infection. FINDINGS: Adverse events were generally mild, but one
               case of fatal suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction
               occurred. 72.2\% of the immunocompromised patients seroconverted
               compared to 100\% of the controls (p=0.004). Lowest
               seroconversion rates were found in the SOT (43.4\%) and CLL
               (63.3\%) patient groups with observed negative impact of
               treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and ibrutinib,
               respectively. INTERPRETATION: The results showed that the mRNA
               BNT162b2 vaccine was safe in immunocompromised patients. Rate of
               seroconversion was substantially lower than in healthy controls,
               with a wide range of rates and antibody titres among predefined
               patient groups and subgroups. This clinical trial highlights the
               need for additional vaccine doses in certain immunocompromised
               patient groups to improve immunity. FUNDING: Knut and Alice

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: As SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage increases in the
               United States (US), there is a need to understand the real-world
               effectiveness against severe Covid-19 and among people at
               increased risk for poor outcomes. METHODS: In a multicenter
               case-control analysis of US adults hospitalized March 11-May 5,
               2021, we evaluated vaccine effectiveness to prevent Covid-19
               hospitalizations by comparing odds of prior vaccination with an
               mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) between cases
               hospitalized with Covid-19 and hospital-based controls who
               tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1212
               participants, including 593 cases and 619 controls, median age
               was 58 years, 22.8\% were Black, 13.9\% were Hispanic, and
               21.0\% had immunosuppression. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (Alpha)
               was the most common variant (67.9\% of viruses with lineage
               determined). Full vaccination (receipt of two vaccine doses
               $\geq$14 days before illness onset) had been received by 8.2\%
               of cases and 36.4\% of controls. Overall vaccine effectiveness
               was 87.1\% (95\% CI: 80.7 to 91.3\%). Vaccine effectiveness was
               similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and highest in
               adults aged 18-49 years (97.4\%; 95\% CI: 79.3 to 99.7\%). Among
               45 patients with vaccine-breakthrough Covid hospitalizations, 44
               (97.8\%) were $\geq$50 years old and 20 (44.4\%) had
               immunosuppression. Vaccine effectiveness was lower among
               patients with immunosuppression (62.9\%; 95\% CI: 20.8 to
               82.6\%) than without immunosuppression (91.3\%; 95\% CI: 85.6 to
               94.8\%). CONCLUSION: During March-May 2021, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
               vaccines were highly effective for preventing Covid-19
               hospitalizations among US adults. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was
               beneficial for patients with immunosuppression, but
               effectiveness was lower in the immunosuppressed population.",

               showed 95\% efficacy in preventing symptomatic disease; however,
               the trials excluded immunocompromised patients (ICPs). We aim at
               analyzing antibody response in ICPs. Methods: A prospective
               cohort study was conducted at Sheba Medical Center, Israel,
               between January and April 2020, in 1274 participants who
               received the vaccine, including 1002 ICPs and 272
               immunocompetent healthcare workers (HCWs). Antibodies were
               measured two-four weeks after vaccination by SARS-CoV-2
               anti-receptor binding domain IgG antibodies (RBD IgG) and
               pseudo-virus neutralization assays. Multivariable logistic
               regression analyses were used to identify factors associated
               with vaccine-induced antibody response. Adverse events (AEs)
               were monitored. Findings: RBD-IgG antibodies were detected in
               154/156 (98.7\%) of patients with HIV, 75/90 (83.3\%) with solid
               malignancies, 149/187 (79.7\%) with myeloma, 83/111 (74.8\%)
               following hematopoietic stem cell transplants, 25/36 (69.4\%)
               following liver transplantation, 26/43 (60.5\%) with
               myelodysplastic syndrome, 96/188 (51.0\%) with chronic
               lymphocytic leukemia/non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 50/110 (45.5\%)
               following kidney transplantation, 15/80 (18.8\%) following heart
               transplantation, and 269/272 (98.9\%) in controls. There was a
               significant correlation r = 0.74 (95\%CI 0.69,0.78) between
               RBD-binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies in all groups.
               Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age > 65
               years (OR 0.41,95\%CI 0.30,0.57) and underlying
               immunosuppression (OR 0.02,95\%CI 0.01,0.07) were significantly
               associated with a non-reactive response of IgG antibodies. HIV
               patients showed a similar immunological response as healthy
               adults. The vaccine was safe without any episodes of rejection,
               graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or allergy. Immunocompetent
               HCWs experienced significantly more AEs than ICPs.
               Interpretation: Antibody response to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
               was highly variable among different ICPs; thus, individual
               recommendations should be provided for the different
               immunosuppression states.",

               vast majority of cases. The elderly with a higher risk of

               impacted liver transplant (LT) activity across the world, with
               notable decreases in the number of donations and procedures in
               most Western countries, in particular throughout the first wave.
               The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in LT recipients (with
               estimates ranging from 0.34\% to 1.56\%) appears to be at least
               comparable to that observed for the general population. Clinical
               and radiological features at presentation are also similar to
               non-transplant patients. The risk of death among LT recipients
               requiring hospital admission is high (from 12\% to 19\%),
               although some authors have suggested that overall mortality may
               be actually lower compared to the general non-transplant
               population. It is likely that these poor outcomes may be mainly
               influenced by the older age and higher comorbidity burden of LT
               recipients, rather than by the transplant status itself. In
               fact, it has been hypothesized that post-transplant
               immunosuppression would exert a protective role, with special
               focus on tacrolimus-containing regimens. There is scarce
               evidence to guide the optimal management of post-transplant
               COVID-19 and the use of antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies,
               although both clinical practice and guidelines support the dose
               reduction or withdrawal of anti-proliferative agents such as
               mofetil mycophenolate. Preliminary reports suggest that the
               antibody response to messenger RNA vaccines is significantly
               impaired as compared to non-immunocompromised individuals, in
               line with other transplant populations. Finally, it is
               foreseeable that the future will be conditioned by the emerging
               variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with
               increased transmissibility among LT recipients.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an
               unprecedented event with massive global health and
               socio-economic impacts on vulnerable populations, especially
               people living with HIV. The epidemic has severely affected
               Thailand's economy and potentially impacted the financial and
               psychological wellbeing of Thai HIV-positive men who have sex
               with men (MSM). METHODS: Between 15 June and 10 December 2020,
               we conducted qualitative interviews with 26 MSM living with HIV
               in Thailand who participate in an Adam's Love We Care Study. We
               intentionally recruited individuals who may have experienced a
               greater impact of COVID-19. Interviews explored worry, stigma
               and stress surrounding COVID-19, and multiple domains of
               potential COVID-19 impact: financial/employment, HIV service
               delivery and antiretroviral (ART) adherence during the first 10
               months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Participants perceived
               themselves as immunocompromised and susceptible, and feared
               contracting COVID-19. Participants worried that contracting
               COVID-19 would lead to HIV status disclosure and stigmatization.
               Participants had considerable worry about job loss as a result
               of the economic downturn, and some shared challenges associated
               with relocation and re-engaging with HIV care. Financial stress
               and lack of basic necessities caused by job losses were commonly
               reported. Participants reported optimal ART adherence as a
               consequence of local HIV service delivery responses, convenient
               ART refills and Adam's Love online support interventions.
               CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights that the COVID-19 pandemic
               produced high levels of anxiety and concerns about additional
               stigma among MSM living with HIV. It had a significant negative
               effect on the daily lives of our participants. These findings
               indicate a need for the provision of confidential COVID-19
               diagnosis and care, relief programmes, vaccination roll-out
               equity, and addressing employment needs of vulnerable

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The risk of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is
               increased in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because of its
               direct impact in altering innate immunity and is further
               exacerbated by widespread use of steroids/antibiotics/monoclonal
               antibodies. The study aims to describe this recently increased
               clinical entity in association with COVID-19. METHOD: A
               prospective, longitudinal study including patients diagnosed
               with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) who recently
               recovered from COVID-19 infection or after an asymptomatic
               carrier state. A single-center, descriptive study investigating
               demographic details, clinical presentation, radio-pathological
               aspects, and advocated management. RESULT: A total of 21
               patients were included with a mean age of 49.62 years (SD:
               14.24). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was the most common underlying
               disorder (90.48\%), and 63.16\% of all patients with DM had a
               recent onset DM, either diagnosed during or after COVID-19
               infection. Nineteen patients (90.48\%) had recently recovered
               from active COVID-19 infection, and all had a history of prior
               steroid treatment (oral/parenteral). Remaining 2 patients were
               asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. Surprisingly, 2 patients had no
               underlying disorder, and 5 (23.81\%) recently received the
               Covishield vaccine. Fungal analysis exhibited Mucor (95.24\%)
               and Aspergillus species (14.29\%). Most common sign/symptom was
               headache and facial/periorbital pain (85.71\%), followed by
               facial/periorbital swelling (61.90\%). Disease involvement:
               sinonasal (100\%), orbital (47.62\%), pterygopalatine fossa
               (28.58\%), infratemporal fossa (14.29\%), intracranial
               (23.81\%), and skin (9.52\%). Exclusive endoscopic debridement
               and combined approach were utilized in 61.90\% and 38.10\%,
               respectively. Both liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole
               were given in all patients except one. CONCLUSION: A high
               suspicion of AIFRS should be kept in patients with recent
               COVID-19 infection who received steroids and presenting with
               headache, facial pain, and/or facial swelling. Asymptomatic
               COVID-19 carriers and COVID-19 vaccinated candidates are also
               observed to develop AIFRS, although the exact
               immuno-pathogenesis is still unknown. Prompt diagnosis and early

               cause an acute respiratory illness in adults, the elderly and
               immunocompromised, while children were known to be afflicted
               with milder symptoms. However, since mid-April of 2020, latent
               effects of the virus have begun emerging in children and
               adolescents, which is characterised by a multisystem
               hyperinflammatory state; thus, the term Multisystem Inflammatory
               Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was introduced by the WHO and CDC.
               The syndrome manifests itself approximately 4 weeks after
               COVID-19 infection, with symptoms mimicking Kawasaki Disease and
               Kawasaki Disease Shock Syndrome. Demographically, MIS-C peaks in
               children aged 5 to 14 years, with clusters in Europe, North and
               Latin America seen, later followed by Asia. Although the exact
               pathophysiology behind the syndrome is unknown, recent studies
               have proposed a post-infectious immune aetiology, which explains
               the increased levels of immunoglobulins seen in affected
               patients. Patient presentation includes, but is not limited to,
               persistent fever, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac
               complications including myocarditis. These patients also have
               raised inflammatory markers including C reactive protein,
               ferritin and interleukin-6. In poorly controlled patients, the
               syndrome can lead to multiorgan failure and death. The mainstay
               of treatment includes the use of intravenous immunoglobulins,
               steroids, immune modulators and aspirin. Adjunct therapy
               includes the use of low molecular weight heparin or warfarin for
               long term anticoagulation. Currently very little is known about
               the syndrome, highlighting the need for awareness amongst
               healthcare workers and parents. Moreover, with increased cases
               of COVID-19 as a result of the second wave, it is essential to
               keep MIS-C in mind when attending patients with a past history
               of COVID-19 exposure or infection. Additionally, once these
               patients have been identified and treated, strict follow-up must
               be done in order carry out long term studies, and to identify
               possible sequelae and complications.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Background: Individuals with comorbid conditions
               have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Since
               regulatory trials with COVID-19 vaccines excluded those with
               immunocompromising conditions, few patients with cancer and
               autoimmune diseases were enrolled. With limited vaccine safety
               data available vulnerable populations may have conflicted
               vaccine attitudes. OBJECTIVE: Objective: We sought to assess the
               prevalence and independent predictors of COVID-19 vaccine
               hesitancy and acceptance among individuals with serious
               comorbidities, and to assess self-reported side-effects among
               those who had received the vaccine. METHODS: Methods: We
               conducted a cross-sectional 55-item online survey, fielded
               January 15, 2021 through February 22, 2021, among a random
               sample of members of Inspire, an online health community of over
               2.2 million individuals with comorbid conditions. Multivariable
               regression analysis was utilized to determine factors
               independently associated with vaccine hesitancy and acceptance.
               RESULTS: Results: Of the 996,500 members of the Inspire health
               community who were invited to participate responses were
               received from 21,943 individuals (2.2\%). Respondents resided in
               123 countries (74\% USA), had a median age range 56-65 years,
               were highly educated (60\% holding college or post-graduate
               degrees), and had diverse political leanings. All respondents
               self-reported at least one co-morbidity, with 27\% having
               cancer, 23\% autoimmune diseases, and 38\% chronic lung
               diseases. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was identified in 18.6\%,
               with 2190 (10.3\%) declaring that they would not, 742 (3.4\%)
               stating that they probably would not, and 1028 (4.8\%) not sure
               whether they would agree to be vaccinated. Hesitancy was
               expressed by 13.4\% cancer patients, 19.4\% with autoimmune
               diseases, and 17.8\% with chronic lung diseases. Positive
               predictors of vaccine acceptance included routine influenza
               vaccination (odds ratio 1.53), trust in responsible vaccine
               development (odds ratio 14.04), residing in the USA (odds ratio
               1.31) and never smoker status (odds ratio 1.06). Hesitancy was
               increased with a history of prior COVID-19 (odds ratio .86),
               conservative political leaning (odds ratio .93), younger age
               (odds ratio .83), and lower education level (odds ratio .90).
               One quarter (5501 participants) had received at least one
               COVID-19 vaccine injection and 1390 (6.2\%) completed a two-dose
               series. Following the first injection, 69\% self-reported local
               and 40\% systemic reactions, which increased following the
               second injection to 76\% and 67\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
               Conclusions: In this survey of individuals with serious comorbid
               conditions significant vaccine hesitancy remains. Assumptions
               that the most vulnerable would automatically accept COVID-19
               vaccination are erroneous and thus call for healthcare team
               members to initiate discussions focusing on the impact of the
               vaccine on an individual's underlying condition. Early
               self-reported side-effect experiences among those who have
               already been vaccinated, as expressed by our population, should
               be reassuring and might be utilized to alleviate vaccine fears.
               Healthcare related social media forums which rapidly disseminate
               accurate information about the COVID-19 vaccine may play an
               important role.",

               RESULTS: A total of 1594 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were
               hospitalised during the study period. 166 (10.4\%) were

               (27.1\% vs 13.5\%, p < 0.001). After adjustment,
               immunosuppression remained as an independent factor related to
               mortality (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.24, p < 0.001). In the
               immunosuppressed group, age (OR = 1.06, p = 0.01), acute

  abstract  = "Background and Aims: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
               infected over 93 million people worldwide as of January 14,
               2021. Various studies have gathered data on liver transplant
               patients infected with COVID-19. Here, we discuss the
               presentation of COVID-19 in immunosuppressed patients with prior
               liver transplants. We also evaluate patient outcomes after
               infection. Methods: We searched the PubMed database for all
               studies focused on liver transplant patients with COVID-19.
               Results: We identified eight studies that evaluated COVID-19
               infection in liver transplant patients (n=494). Hypertension was
               the most prevalent comorbidity in our cohort. Calcineurin
               inhibitors were the most common immunosuppressant medications in
               the entire cohort. The average time from liver transplant to
               COVID-19 infection in our cohort was 74.1 months. Fever and
               cough, at 70\% and 62\% respectively, were the most common
               symptoms in our review. In total, 50\% of the patients received
               hydroxychloroquine as treatment for COVID-19. The next most
               prevalent treatment was azithromycin, given to 30\% of patients
               in our cohort. In total, 80\% of the patients were admitted to a
               hospital and 17\% required intensive care unit-level care, with
               21\% having required mechanical ventilation. Overall mortality
               was 17\% in our review. Conclusions: Given the immunocompromised
               status of liver transplant patients, more intensive surveillance
               is necessary for severe cases of COVID-19 infection. As liver
               transplantations have been restricted during the COVID-19
               pandemic, further investigation is warranted for studying the

              lead not only to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but also can
              result in thromboembolic events in both the venous and the
              arterial circulation by inducing coagulation disorders. The
              potential causes of coagulopathy are inflammation, platelet
              activation, endothelial dysfunction, and stasis. The thrombotic
              events including pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis as
              well as intracatheter thrombosis are more likely to develop in
              patients infected with severe form of SARS-CoV-2 who are admitted
              to ICU. Furthermore, these events contribute to multi-organ
              failure. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a case of an
              immunocompromised COVID-19 elderly patient with acute lymphocytic
              leukemia who developed myocardial infarction with ST elevation in
              the setting of acute pulmonary thromboembolism in the presence of
              zero platelet count. Despite successful urgent coronary
              revascularization and platelet transfusion, the patient
              eventually died after failed resuscitation efforts. CONCLUSION:
              Patients with COVID-19 infection are at a greater risk of
              developing cardiovascular complications, but their appropriate
              management can decrease the risk of fatal events. Coronary
              thrombosis associated with pulmonary thromboembolism in the
              setting of thrombocytopenia is a rare and a complex to manage
              condition. Significance of single antiplatelet agent in STEMI
              with thrombocytopenia merits further studies. According to expert
              opinions and literature reviews, we must avoid dual antiplatelet
              therapy in these patients and keep platelet transfusion as a
              standard therapy to avoid drastic bleeding complications.",

               patient trends in a burn and plastic unit and assesses the
               effect of COVID-19 infection in burns. Methods This
               single-center, retrospective observational case-control study
               was conducted in the Department of Burns, Plastic and
               Maxillofacial Surgery of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi,

               burns and trauma patients collected was analyzed and compared.
               Results There were total 350 admissions during COVID time period
               and 562 admissions during non-COVID time period. The admission
               rate, type of burn injury, and death rate did not vary
               significantly during the two time periods. Thermal burn was the
               most common type of burn injury. There were total 18 cases
               diagnosed to be COVID-19 positive during the pandemic. There
               were two deaths among COVID-19 positive burn cases. Conclusion
               This study finds no difference in patient patterns during COVID

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Adjunctive therapy with polyclonal intravenous
               immunoglobins (IVIg) is currently used for preventing or
               managing infections and sepsis, especially in immunocompromised
               patients. The pathobiology of COVID-19 and the mechanisms of
               action of Ig led to the consideration of this adjunctive
               therapy, including in patients with respiratory failure due to
               the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This manuscript reports the rationale,
               the available data and the results of a structured consensus on
               intravenous Ig therapy in patients with severe COVID-19.
               METHODS: A panel of multidisciplinary experts defined the
               clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory
               failure and, after literature review, voted for the agreement on
               the rationale and the potential role of IVIg therapy for each
               phenotype. Due to the scarce evidence available, a modified
               RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used. RESULTS: Three
               different phenotypes of COVID-19 patients with severe
               respiratory failure were identified: patients with an abrupt and
               dysregulated hyperinflammatory response (early phase), patients
               with suspected immune paralysis (late phase) and patients with
               sepsis due to a hospital-acquired superinfection (sepsis by
               bacterial superinfection). The rationale for intravenous Ig
               therapy in the early phase was considered uncertain whereas the
               panelists considered its use in the late phase and patients with
               sepsis/septic shock by bacterial superinfection appropriate.
               CONCLUSION: As with other immunotherapies, IVIg adjunctive
               therapy may have a potential role in the management of COVID-19
               patients. The ongoing trials will clarify the appropriate target

               used were evaluated and analyzed using multiple regression
               analysis. RESULTS: A total of 245 patients with a mean age of
               49.59 years were included with a mortality rate of 8.16\%. The
               administration of Remdesivir as an anti-viral drug (P value <

               risk factors among nursing home (NH) residents. METHODS:
               Retrospective cohort study covering Medicare fee-for-service
               beneficiaries ages $\geq$65 residing in U.S. NHs. We estimated
               adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) using multivariate Cox proportional
               hazards regressions. RESULTS: Among 608,251 elderly NH
               residents, 57,398 (9.4\%) died of COVID-related illness April 1
               to December 22, 2020. About 46.9\% (26,893) of these COVID-19
               deaths occurred without prior COVID-19 hospitalizations. We
               observed a consistently increasing age trend for COVID-19
               deaths. Racial/ethnic minorities generally shared a similarly
               high risk of NH COVID-19 deaths with Whites. NH facility
               characteristics including for-profit ownership and low health
               inspection ratings were associated with higher death risk.
               Resident characteristics, including male (HR 1.69), end-stage
               renal disease (HR 1.42), cognitive impairment (HR 1.34), and
               immunocompromised status (HR 1.20) were important death risk
               factors. Other individual-level characteristics were less
               predictive of death than they were in community-dwelling
               population. CONCLUSIONS: Low NH health inspection ratings and
               private ownership contributed to COVID-19 death risks. Nearly
               half of NH COVID-19 deaths occurred without prior COVID-19
               hospitalization and older residents were less likely to get
               hospitalized with COVID-19. No substantial differences were
               observed by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status for NH

               novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was initially described in Wuhan,

               with chronic diseases such as hematological malignancies are
               prone to develop severe pneumonia. The humoral immunity of
               patients with multiple myeloma is prevalently low, and their
               inferior immunity further deteriorates during chemotherapy. For
               patients with onco-hematological malignancies infected with
               2019-nCoV during the first chemotherapy cycle, the clinical
               treatment experience is lacking. The present study is a report
               of a 61-year-old patient newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma
               in the key 2019-nCoV outbreak area, who suffered severe

               patients with severe pneumonia were prospectively enrolled, most

               characteristics (including plasma biomarkers of coagulopathy)
               were compared. Results: At similar baseline severity, COVID-19
               patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) for significantly
               longer than non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0049) and more
               frequently developed venous thrombotic complications (p =
               0.031). COVID-19 patients had significantly higher plasma
               concentrations of soluble VCAM1 (sVCAM1) (5,739 $\pm$ 3,293 vs.
               3,700 $\pm$ 2,124 ng/ml; p = 0.009), but lower levels of

               to non-COVID-19 patients. Principal component analysis
               identified two main patterns, with a clear distinction between
               non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients. Multivariable regression
               analysis confirmed that sVCAM1 rising levels were independently
               associated with a longer duration of MV. Finally, we identified
               close correlations between sVCAM1 and some features of COVID-19

               patients with cancer during a pandemic has proven challenging.
               Patients with cancer on chemotherapy have a high risk of
               mortality if contracted COVID-19. If a patient goes directly to
               the emergency room, multiple contact points with other
               individuals can lead to unnecessary exposures from any airborne
               virus, such as COVID-19. Our cancer center has implemented an
               isolated clinic with personal protective equipment and direct
               access to a COVID-19 rule-out floor to manage those with febrile
               neutropenia (FN). METHODS: We implemented an outpatient,
               isolated, extended-hour clinic with access to personal
               protective equipment, laboratories, and antibiotics for patients
               with FN as a pilot project from April 1 to December 31, 2020,
               with the aim to decrease emergency department (ED) visits for FN
               by 50\%. RESULTS: Since the implementation of our clinic, we
               have screened 74 unique patients during 102 visits, of which 76
               led to a discharge and 26 led to a direct admit, thus avoiding
               the ED. Thirty-nine of these visits were for patients with
               recent travel or a known COVID-19 exposure. Bringing these
               patients to our isolated clinic ensured safety of the
               approximately 200 patients undergoing active treatment in our
               infusion center daily. CONCLUSION: Implementing this clinic has
               thus far successfully decreased the social footprint of our
               highest-risk patients with cancer in the ED considerably. Our
               efforts and hopes of decreasing the possible exposure of our
               immunocompromised patients to COVID-19 as well as the

              the world, especially the elderly and immunocompromised
              individuals. The infection transmission rate is considered more
              rapid than other deadly pandemics and severe epidemics
              encountered earlier, such as Ebola, Zika, Influenza, Marburg,
              SARS, and MERS. The public health situation therefore is really
              at a challenging crossroads. Main body: The internal and external
              and resident microbiota community is crucial in human health and
              is essential for immune responses. This community tends to be
              altered due to pathogenic infections which would lead to severity
              of the disease as it progresses. Few of these resident microflora
              become negatively active during infectious diseases leading to
              coinfection, especially the opportunistic pathogens. Once such a
              condition sets in, it is difficult to diagnose, treat, and manage
              COVID-19 in a patient. Conclusion: This review highlights the
              various reported possible coinfections that arise in COVID-19

              controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between
              post-vaccination symptoms and strength of antibody responses is
              unclear. Objective: To determine whether adverse effects caused
              by vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine are
              associated with the magnitude of vaccine-induced antibody levels.
              Design: Single center, prospective, observational cohort study.
              Setting: Participants worked at Walter Reed National Military
              Medical Center and were seen monthly at the Naval Medical
              Research Center Clinical Trials Center. Participants: Generally
              healthy adults that were not severely immunocompromised, had no
              history of COVID-19, and were seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 spike
              protein prior to vaccination. Measures: Severity of
              vaccine-associated symptoms was obtained through participant
              completed questionnaires. Testing for IgG antibodies against
              SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and receptor binding domain was
              conducted using microsphere-based multiplex immunoassays.
              Results: 206 participants were evaluated (69.4\% female, median
              age 41.5 years old). We found no correlation between
              vaccine-associated symptom severity scores and vaccine-induced
              antibody titers one month after vaccination. We also observed
              that 1) post-vaccination symptoms were inversely correlated with
              age and weight and more common in women, 2) systemic symptoms
              were more frequent after the second vaccination, 3) high symptom
              scores after first vaccination were predictive of high symptom
              scores after second vaccination, and 4) older age was associated
              with lower titers. Limitations: Study only observes antibody
              responses and consists of healthy participants. Conclusions: Lack
              of post-vaccination symptoms following receipt of the BNT162b2
              vaccine does not equate to lack of vaccine-induced antibodies one
              month after vaccination. This study also suggests that it may be
              possible to design future mRNA vaccines that confer robust
              antibody responses with lower frequencies of vaccine-associated
              symptoms. Funding: This study was executed by the Infectious

               the term ``COVID-19 and mucormycosis'' up to May 31, 2021.
               RESULTS: After the second wave of COVID-19, the mucormycosis
               outbreak complicates the natural course of COVID-19. COVID-19
               patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with diabetic
               ketoacidosis, excessive glucocorticoid use, prolonged
               neutropenia, malnutrition and any underlying immunocompromised
               conditions are at risk of developing mucormycosis. CONCLUSIONS:
               Hyperglycaemia impairs the motility of phagocytes and also
               decreases the oxidative and non-oxidative mechanism of killing
               the causative pathogen. Chronic hyperglycemia also leads to the
               formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE), which leads
               to cross-linking between key proteins of inflammation and
               connective tissue such as collagen which makes tissue
               susceptible to immunological dysregulation. The receptor for AGE
               (RAGE) is expressed on various inflammatory cells including
               neutrophils and its activation by AGEs leads to activation of
               many down signaling pathways which ultimately leads to
               impairment of the inflammatory response. Hyperglycemia also
               increases serum Nitric Oxide (NO), which decreases neutrophil
               motility and reduces the synthesis and release of various
               inflammatory mediators such as TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$,
               IL-6. It also decreases the expression of adhesion molecules
               such as LFA-1 and ICAM-2, on neutrophils. Steroids cause
               immunosuppression majorly by inhibiting the NF-$\kappa$B pathway
               which is a transcription factor involved in the synthesis of
               many immunological mediators such as Interleukins, cytokines,
               chemokines, etc., and various adhesion molecules.",

               serious problem and challenge for the whole medical community.
               Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections in
               immunocompromised patients have a severe course and may be
               fatal. Increasingly, these bacteria are exhibiting resistance to
               carbapenem antibiotics, which have been used as so-called drugs
               of last resort. The emergence of the new coronavirus and the
               pandemic that it has caused require changes to protect against
               the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2. These changes paradoxically
               may contribute to the spread of other infections. METHODS:
               PubMed, Cochrane Library databases were searched using relevant
               keywords. A literature review of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
               pneumoniae infection in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was
               conducted according to PRISMA recommendations. A written review
               protocol was not prepared. RESULTS: 1016 studies in scientific
               databases were searched. After rejecting duplicate studies, 964
               results were obtained. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were
               then applied, and studies were qualitatively analyzed. Finally,
               11 studies were included in the review. The results of infected
               patients were from six countries. The prevalence of CRKP in
               Covid-19 patients ranged from 0.35-53\%. The majority of CRKP
               infected patients were male (85\%), with a mean age of 61 years.
               Among isolates, the predominant genes were KPC, OXY-48, CTX-M,
               TEM, NDM and SHV. CONCLUSION: The results presented in our
               review indicate the necessity of paying attention to
               carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in
               patients with COVID-19. In order to prevent the increase of
               bacterial resistance, rational antibiotic therapy should be
               used, as well as continuous control and surveillance of hospital
               infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms.",

               with SAMs and 106 non-immunocompromised control group (CTRL).
               All participants received two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac
               vaccine (28-day interval). Immunogenicity was assessed by
               anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG seroconversion (SC), anti-S1/S2 IgG
               geometric mean titer (GMT), factor increase GMT (FI-GMT),

               can be linked to various microbial and fungal coinfections.
               Mucormycosis is an invasive opportunistic infection that enters
               as inhalation of fungal spores through the nose or paranasal
               sinuses in diabetic and immunocompromised patients. We present
               our experience of managing seven cases of recent COVID-19
               infection with uncontrolled diabetes who developed rhino-orbital
               mucormycosis. All patients were diagnosed by clinical
               examination and imaging and managed by emergency surgical
               debridement and liposomal amphotericin-B. A lethal triad of
               impaired immunity due to COVID-19 infection, state of
               hyperglycemia, increased use of steroids, or rampant
               broad-spectrum antimicrobials works as fertile soil and may
               assist in the growth or alleviation of a fungal infection.
               Healthcare professionals must be aware of the potential of

               zoster virus infections in the context of COVID-19 may have
               clinical and prognostic implications. Several reports associated
               this human herpes virus with COVID-19 infection and have claimed
               that it can be an indicator for latent COVID-19 infection.
               However, since most of these were case reports, it is impossible
               to assess the prevalence of these associations. METHODS: The
               University of Florida patient registry i2b2 with ICD-10
               diagnosis codes was used for retrieval of patients with
               diagnosis of COVID-19 and each of the other viruses over the
               period of October 2015-June 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of the
               herpes simplex-1 occurrence in the COVID-19 group was 2.81\%
               compared to 0.77\% in the hospital population odds ratio of
               5.27. When adjusted for gender, race, and age, the odds were
               5.18, 4.48, and 4.61, respectively. After adjustment for
               respiratory disease, endocrine disease, obesity, diabetes,
               circulatory disease, and smoking, the odds were 1.94, 3.18,
               1.37, 3.54, 3.7, and 5.1, respectively. The prevalence of the
               varicella zoster virus in COVID-19 patients was 1.8\% compared
               to 0.43\% in the hospital population, odds ratio of 5.26 before
               adjustment, and 5.2, 5.47, and 4.76 after adjusting for gender,

               psychological distress of cancer patients, a comprehensive
               search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus.
               English language and original articles were included in this

               situation. Although psychological distress affects many people,
               it can confuse cancer patients to the point that they refuse to

               domain immunoglobulin G of 50 AU/ml or greater was present in 53
               of 60 patients (88\%) in the ESKD group and all participants
               (100\%) in the control group (P = 0.05). The percentage of
               patients with ESKD and controls with neutralizing antibodies of
               35\% threshold or greater was 58\% and 88\%, respectively (P =
               0.01). Furthermore, the proportion of patients with ESKD and
               S1-specific T cell response was comparable with controls (82\%
               vs. 77\%, P = 0.45). Old age, high ferritin level, and low
               absolute lymphocyte count were independently associated with
               poor humoral immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESKD
               could develop similar SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune
               responses compared to healthy controls, although suboptimal
               humoral immune responses were observed following two doses of
               SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Therefore, patients with ESKD and the
               abovementioned factors are at risk of generating inadequate
               humoral immune responses, and a vaccine strategy to elicit
               greater immunogenicity among these relatively immunocompromised
               patients is warranted. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry,

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: The objective of our study was to assess, in an
               at-risk population, perception and knowledge about influenza and
               pneumococcal vaccinations. METHODS: An anonymous web-based
               survey was submitted to patients recruited in France, from both
               an Ipsos internal panel and AVNIR patient associations. The
               study was conducted between July and October 2020, in the
               context of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 2177
               questionnaires from patients at risk of infection were analyzed.
               Almost all respondents (86\%, 1869/2177) declared themselves to
               be favorable to vaccination. Nearly half of the patients (49\%,
               1069/2177) were aware of which vaccine was recommended for their
               specific situation. This percentage was significantly (p <
               0.001) higher for members of a patient association and for
               people affected by multiple chronic conditions and varied
               according to the type of condition. Almost two-thirds of
               patients (1373/2177) declared having been vaccinated during the
               2019/2020 influenza season, and 41\% (894/2177) were certain
               about being up to date with the pneumococcal vaccination. The
               main barriers to vaccination for influenza are the fear of side
               effects, doubt regarding the efficacy of the vaccine and for
               pneumococcal vaccination, and the absence of suggestions by the
               healthcare professionals (HCPs), as 64\% of respondents were not
               recommended to obtain pneumococcal vaccination. To improve
               vaccine coverage, information is of prime importance and GPs are
               recognized as the main HCP to inform about vaccination. Nearly
               two-thirds (62\%, 1360/2177) of patients declared that the
               COVID-19 pandemic convinced them to have all the recommended
               vaccines. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted the nonoptimal
               vaccine coverage in at-risk populations despite a highly
               positive perception of vaccines and confirmed that physicians
               are on the front lines to suggest and recommend these
               vaccinations, especially in the current pandemic context, which
               may be used to promote other vaccines.",

               impacted patient-clinician communication, particularly in the
               oncology setting. Relatedly, secure messaging (SM) usage greatly
               increased, yet it is unknown what was discussed and whether the
               technology was utilized to disseminate information. Aims: This
               study aimed at identifying the most frequently discussed topics
               using SM as well as at understanding how the communication
               process transpired during the early stages of the pandemic.
               Materials and Methods: A mixed-methods design was utilized,
               consisting of a content analysis of more than 4,200 secure
               messages, aggregated into 1,454 patient-clinician discussions.
               Data were collected from February 2020 to May 2020. Discussions
               were from various oncology departments and included physicians,
               physician assistants, and nurses. Based on the identified
               categories, a thematic analysis was conducted to understand the
               nuances occurring within discussions. Results: Out of the 1,454
               discussions, 26\% (n = 373) related to COVID-19. Of the COVID-19
               discussion, the most frequently coded category was ``changes,
               adjustments, and re-arranging care'' (65\%, n = 241), followed
               by ``risk for COVID-19'' (24\%, n = 90), ``precautions inside
               the hospital'' (18\%, n = 66), and ``precautions outside the
               hospital'' (14\%, n = 52). Natural language processing
               techniques were used to confirm the validity of the results.
               Thematic analysis revealed that patients were proactive in
               rescheduling appointments, expressed anxiety about being
               immunocompromised, and clinicians were uncertain about providing
               recommendations related to COVID-19. Conclusions: The COVID-19
               outbreak revealed the need for responsive and effective public
               health communication. The SM can disseminate information from
               trusted sources, clinicians, but can be better utilized to
               deliver tailored information for specific patient populations.",

               in the period between June and August 2020. RESULTS: Overall,
               150 responses were received. Almost 20\% patients stopped their
               medications. A total of 61.7\% patients reported no fears

               of mAb therapy in decreasing hospitalizations or emergency room
               (ER) visits among kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with
               COVID-19. We identified KTR with COVID-19 between March 1, 2020
               and April 30, 2021. Patients were excluded if they had
               multi-organ transplant or hospital-acquired COVID-19. We studied
               95 KTR; 20 received mAb. mAb administration was associated with
               a significant decrease in hospitalizations or ER visits (15\%
               vs. 76\%, p < 0.001). This association remained significant

               onset as day 1 (adjusted HR 0.216, p = 0.04). Black or Hispanic
               patients were less likely to receive mAb and more likely to be
               admitted to the hospital or visit the ER. In our KTR population,
               mAb therapy for COVID-19 may have helped decrease
               hospitalizations and ER visits. Healthcare inequities, including
               access to investigational treatments, have been exacerbated by

               as a global health threat. Certain factors like age, an
               immunocompromised state, and social impoverishment, etc. can add
               to health vulnerabilities during this pandemic. One such group
               is older transgender adults, who often bear a combination of
               these risks. As the world is aging fast, their numbers have also
               been increasing. With this in mind, this study explores the
               lived experiences and psychosocial challenges of older
               transgender adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in India.
               Methods: A qualitative approach was used. Ten individuals with
               ``transgender'' identity above the age of 60 were recruited with
               consent through purposive sampling. In-depth interviews were
               conducted on the telephone using a pre-designed interview
               schedule. They were recorded, translated, and transcribed
               verbatim. Hasse's adaptation of Colaizzi's phenomenological
               method was used for analysis. Independent coding and respondent
               validation were used to ensure the rigor of data. Results: The
               super-arching categories (with themes) were marginalization
               (``second'' priority, stigma, social disconnection), the dual
               burden of ``age'' and ``gender'' (ageism, othering, and
               psychosexual difficulties), and multi-faceted survival threats
               (physical, emotional, financial) during the pandemic. Social
               rituals, spirituality, hope, and acceptance of ``gender
               dissonance'' emerged as the main coping factors, whereas their
               unmet needs were social inclusion, awareness related to
               COVID-19, mental health care, and audience to their distress.
               Conclusion: The elderly gender minorities are at increased
               emotional and social risks during the ongoing pandemic, and
               their voices are mostly unheard. The need for policy
               implementation and community awareness about their social

               Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has
               drastically impacted societies worldwide. Vaccination against
               SARS-CoV-2 is expected to play a key role in the management of
               this pandemic. Inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory
               bowel disease (IBD) often require chronic immunosuppression,
               which can influence vaccination decisions. Aim: This review
               article aims to describe the most commonly available SARS-CoV-2
               vaccination vectors globally, assess the potential benefits and
               concerns of vaccination in the setting of immunosuppression and
               provide medical practitioners with guidance regarding SARS-CoV-2
               vaccination in patients with IBD. Methods: All published Phase
               1/2 and/or Phase 3 and 4 studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations were
               reviewed. IBD international society position papers, safety
               registry data and media releases from pharmaceutical companies
               as well as administrative and medicines regulatory bodies were
               included. General vaccine evidence and recommendations in
               immunosuppressed patients were reviewed for context. Society
               position papers regarding special populations, including
               immunosuppressed, pregnant and breast-feeding individuals were
               also evaluated. Literature was critically analysed and
               summarised. Results: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is supported
               in all adult, non-pregnant individuals with IBD without
               contraindication. There is the potential that vaccine efficacy
               may be reduced in those who are immunosuppressed; however,
               medical therapies should not be withheld in order to undertake
               vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe, but data specific to
               immunosuppressed patients remain limited. Conclusions:
               SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is essential from both an individual
               patient and community perspective and should be encouraged in
               patients with IBD. Recommendations must be continually updated

               100 years, and at its onset, the effects were largely unknown.
               Immunocompromised patients, including IBD, were presumed to have
               higher risk. AIMS: We hypothesized patients with IBD would have
               higher-than-baseline anxiety, high perceived vulnerability and
               significant lifestyle impacts as a result of the pandemic. We
               sought to assess the impact of these changes on disease and
               management. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients with
               Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and IBD-unspecified was
               conducted. Patients were invited to participate by email in an
               IRB-approved brief, voluntary survey. Survey questions focused
               on disease characteristics, healthcare access and self-reported
               psychological well-being. RESULTS: Responses from 492 (CD = 337,
               UC = 141,IC = 14) patients were included in the analysis. The
               majority of patients with IBD had increased anxiety since the
               pandemic, which correlated with an increase in GI symptoms. This
               risk of symptoms was mitigated by communication with their
               provider. Many patients had lifestyle changes including
               requesting time off work due to perceived vulnerability and
               changes in eating habits. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an
               increase in illness-associated anxiety and perceived
               vulnerability among patients with IBD during the COVID-19
               pandemic. Open communication with providers is important to
               maintain adequate control of disease and reduce symptoms of

               prospective descriptive cohort study, consecutive critically ill
               patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who received at
               least one dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were included. The time
               of study was from 1 July to 10 August of 2021. Results: Of the
               94 consecutive patients from seven Andalusian ICUs admitted
               during the time of study, 50 (53.2\%) received at least one dose

               the first case of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China on January 8, 2020,
               after sequencing the first viral genetic material. Since then,
               many vaccines were rushed into testing, bypassing animal
               experimentations, with more than 200 pharma companies in
               different countries declaring the development of different
               vaccines, each with their own strategy for generating immunity,
               despite the arguments of many infectious disease experts that 18
               months for a first vaccine is an incredibly aggressive schedule
               because it takes an average of 10 years to develop a vaccine.
               Ten vaccine candidates have already entered phase 3 clinical
               trials in humans. These vaccines rely on different types of
               technology, the most innovative of which use the genetic
               material messenger RNA. Many provocative questions and genuine
               concerns have been raised, such as short durations of efficacy
               and safety follow-ups, lack of identified correlates of

               multiple ways. Because most cancer patients are comorbid or
               immunocompromised, we are trying as much as possible to reduce
               their risk of infection. Marginal just 2 years ago, telemedicine
               quickly became preeminent with the pandemic to reduce hospital
               exposure. However, using only virtual visits in oncology
               patients risk delaying cancer diagnosis or the identification of
               a complication. CASE SERIES: We present here four cases where a
               serious medical problem evident on physical exam was overlooked
               during a virtual visit. Two of our patients experienced a delay
               in cancer diagnosis thus putting them at risk of local or
               distant spread. The two others were established oncology
               patients where a serious medical complication was missed on a
               virtual visit. CONCLUSIONS: Now more than a year into the
               pandemic, telemedicine has clearly been a useful tool by
               limiting unnecessary hospital visits. Yet, as our cases
               illustrate, its use in oncology without clear boundary can
               undermine the quality of care. Now that effective vaccines are
               reducing the transmission and the severity of infection, most
               oncology patients can be evaluated by a real-time visit.",

               blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase
               chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 5 positive nasopharyngeal swabs, we

               characterize T- and NK-cell subsets. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
               on nasopharyngeal swabs samples remained positive for 268 days.
               All 5 performed viral cultures were positive, and genomic
               analysis confirmed a persistent infection with the same strain.
               Viremia resulted positive in 3 out of 4 COVID-19 clinical
               relapses and cleared each time after remdesivir treatment. The
               T- and NK-cell dynamic was different in aviremic and viremic

               Viremia was associated with COVID-19 relapses, and remdesivir

               results was lower among HIV-positives (p= 0.038). The frequency
               of COVID-19 and HIV coinfection was lower than expected among
               confirmed cases (adjusted OR= 0.54; 95\% CI: 0.29-1.02) and
               suspected cases (adjusted OR= 0.68; 95\% CI: 0.45- 1.02), which

               HIV-positive cases. HIV infection decreased the risk of death
               among confirmed (adjusted HR= 0.33; 95\% CI: 0.05-2.32),

              aimed to assess PET/CT uptake in the deltoid muscle and axillary

              vaccine, and to evaluate its association with patients' age and
              immune status. Methods: All consecutive adult subjects undergoing
              PET/CT scans with any radiotracer at our center during the first
              month of a national COVID-19 vaccination rollout (between 23
              December 2020 and January 27, 2021) were included. Data regarding
              clinical status, laterality and time interval from recent
              COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was prospectively collected and
              retrospectively analyzed, and correlated with deltoid muscle and
              axillary lymph nodes uptake. Results: Of 426 eligible, recently
              vaccinated, subjects (median age, 67$\pm$12 years; 49\% female),
              377 (88\%) underwent PET/CT with F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
              and positive axillary lymph node uptake was seen in 45\% of them.
              Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a strong
              inverse association between positive FDG uptake in ipsilateral
              lymph nodes and patients' age (Odds Ratio [OR]=0.57, 95\% CI,
              0.45-0.72; p<.001), immunosuppressive treatment (OR=0.37, 95\%

              (OR=0.44, 95\% CI, 0.24-0.8; P = 0.021). No such association was
              found for deltoid muscle uptake. The number of days from the last
              vaccination and the number of vaccination doses were also
              significantly associated with increased odds of positive lymph
              nodes uptake. Conclusion: Following mRNA-based COVID-19
              vaccination, a high proportion of patients showed ipsilateral
              lymph node axillary uptake, which was more common in
              immunocompetent patients. This information will help recognize

               Mucorales using the silkworm (Bombyx mori) model. The strains'

               anaerobic conditions, respectively. The yeast colonies of Mucor

               quarantine. METHODS: A cross-sectional study included 355
               adolescents with chronic conditions and 111 healthy adolescents.
               An online self-rated survey was used to investigate
               socio-demographic features, healthcare routine, and the
               quarantine impact on physical and mental health. The validated
               self-reported version of the Strengths and Difficulties
               Questionnaire (SDQ) was also applied. RESULTS: The median of age
               [14 (10-18) vs. 15 (10-18) years, p = 0.733] and frequencies of
               female (61\% vs. 60\%, p = 0.970) were similar between
               adolescents with preexisting chronic conditions and healthy
               adolescents during quarantine of COVID-19 pandemic. The
               frequencies of abnormal total difficulties score of SDQ were
               similar in patients and controls (30\% vs. 31\%, p = 0.775).
               Logistic regression analysis showed that being female (OR =
               1.965; 95\% CI = 1.091-3.541, p = 0.024), fear of underlying
               disease activity/complication (OR = 1.009; 95\%CI = 1.001-1.018,
               p = 0.030) were associated with severe psychosocial dysfunction
               in adolescents with chronic conditions, whereas school homework
               (OR = 0.449; 95\% CI = 0.206-0.981, p = 0.045) and physical
               activity (OR = 0.990; 95\% CI = 0.981-0.999, p = 0.030) were
               protective factors. Further analysis of patients with chronic
               immunocompromised conditions and previous diagnosis of mental
               disorders (9\%) compared with patients without diagnosis showed
               higher median of total difficulties score (p = 0.001), emotional
               (p = 0.005), conduct (p = 0.007), peer problems (p = 0.001) and

               Adolescents with preexisting chronic immunocompromised
               conditions during COVID-19 quarantine were not at higher risk of
               adverse health indicators. Being female, fear of underlying
               disease activity/complication, and household members working
               outside of the home were relevant issues for adolescents with
               preexisting chronic conditions. This study reinforces the need

               comorbidities or immunocompromised states. Aim of this
               systematic review is to summarize lung histopathological
               characteristics of COVID-19, not only for diagnostic purpose but
               also to evaluate changes that can reflect pathophysiological
               pathways that can inform clinicians of useful treatment
               strategies. We identified following histopathological changes

               interstitial cells involvement; alveolar cells, type I
               pneumocytes/ type II pneumocytes involvement; interstitial and/

               vaccination in comparison with full doses has been conducted for
               the following pathogens: influenza virus, rabies virus,
               poliovirus (PV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus
               (HAV), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis bacterias (DTP), human

               meningococcus, varicella zoster virus (VZV) and yellow fever
               virus. The findings suggest that the use of the intradermal
               route represents a valid strategy in terms of efficacy and
               efficiency for influenza, rabies and HBV vaccines. Some
               systematic reviews on influenza vaccines suggest the absence of
               a substantial difference between immunogenicity induced by a
               fractional ID dose of up to 20\% and the IM dose in healthy
               adults, elderly, immunocompromised patients and children.

               (HAV, DTP bacterias, JE, meningococcal disease, VZV, and yellow

               highlighted the necessity to optimize vaccine responses in
               immunocompromised populations. We investigated the safety and
               immunogenicity of a third, booster, dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2
               vaccine in heart transplant (HT) patients. METHODS: The cohort
               comprised 96 adult HT patients who received a third homologous
               dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine 168 days after the second dose. The
               vaccine-induced antibody responses of both receptor-binding
               domain (RBD) IgG and neutralizing antibodies were assessed in
               all patients, with a positive antibody response being defined as
               the presence of either IgG anti-RBD or neutralizing antibodies.
               For a subset of patients, T cell response was also studied.
               RESULTS: The third dose was associated with a low rate of
               adverse events, mostly mild pain at the injection site. No
               serious adverse events were recorded, and there were no episodes
               of rejection. At 18 days following the third dose of the
               vaccine, the positive antibody response increased from 23\% to
               67\%, with a corresponding increase in neutralizing capacity.
               The third dose elicited SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers >9-fold
               and IgG anti-RBD antibodies >3-fold of the range achieved after
               the two primary doses. Mycophenolate use, lower eGFR and higher
               C-reactive protein were independently associated with a reduced
               likelihood of generating an immune response. Importantly, a
               specific T-cell response following the third dose was evident in
               the majority of transplant recipients. CONCLUSIONS: An
               homologous third booster dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine gave
               overall consistent tolerability and a good safety profile, while
               eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses.",

               September 30, 2020. All COVID-19-positive patients were divided
               into two groups: group A was comprised of pregnant/postpartum
               and group B of non-pregnant patients. Result: A total of 709
               women (Group A-205, Group B-504) were included in the study, In
               group A 90\% of patients were asymptomatic, while in group B

               from symptomatic COVID-19 infections has represented the only
               feasible health tool to combat the spread of the disease.
               However, at the same time the development and regulatory
               assessment of different vaccines has challenged pharmaceutical
               industries and regulatory agencies as this process has occurred
               in the shorter time ever though. So far, two mRNA and two
               adenovirus-vectored vaccines have received a conditional
               marketing authorisation in the EU and other countries. This
               review summarized and discusses the assessment reports of the
               European Medicine Agency (EMA) concerning the safety of the 3
               vaccines currently used in the EU (Pfizer, Moderna and
               Astra-Zeneca). A particular focus has been paid to safety
               information from pre-clinical (animal) and clinical (phase 3
               trials) studies. Overall, the most frequent adverse effects
               reported after the administration of these vaccines consisted of
               local reactions at the injection site (sore arm and erythema)
               followed by non-specific systemic effects (myalgia, chills,
               fatigue, headache, and fever), which occurred soon after
               vaccination and resolved shortly. Rare cases of vaccine-induced
               immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia have been reported for
               Vaxzevria. Data on long-term studies, interaction with other

               immunocompromised subjects, and in subjects with comorbidities,
               autoimmune or inflammatory disorders are still missing for these
               vaccines. Therefore, careful follow-up and surveillance studies
               for continued vaccine safety monitoring will be needed to
               ascertain the potential risks of such adverse events or
               diseases. In conclusion, the benefits and risks of current
               COVID-19 vaccines must be weighed against the real possibility
               of contract the disease and develop complications and long-term

              D796H conferred decreased sensitivity to convalescent plasma,
              whilst maintaining infectivity similar to wild type. D796H
              appeared to be the main contributor to decreased susceptibility,
              but incurred an infectivity defect. The $\Delta$ H69/ $\Delta$
              V70 single mutant had two-fold higher infectivity compared to
              wild type and appeared to compensate for the reduced infectivity
              of D796H. Consistent with the observed mutations being outside
              the RBD, monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD were not
              impacted by either or both mutations, but a non RBD binding
              monoclonal antibody was less potent against $\Delta$ H69/
              $\Delta$ V70 and the double mutant. These data reveal strong
              selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy
              associated with emergence of viral variants with reduced
              susceptibility to neutralising antibodies.",

               acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, or more
               severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may be
               higher in immunocompromised individuals receiving
               immunomodulatory therapies compared with immunocompetent
               individuals. Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for
               the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis,
               ulcerative colitis, and polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic
               arthritis. To date, data on tofacitinib treatment during the
               COVID-19 pandemic are limited. Objectives: To summarize current
               understanding of the use of tofacitinib in adults during the
               COVID-19 pandemic, and discuss research questions that are yet
               to be addressed, to further inform the safe and effective use of
               tofacitinib in clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a review
               of the literature (as of February 2021), to summarize the expert
               recommendations for the management of rheumatoid arthritis,
               psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis in the context of
               COVID-19, and to assess the current data regarding the use of

               Current recommendations for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic
               arthritis, and ulcerative colitis state that tofacitinib
               treatment should be continued during the pandemic, except in
               cases of positive or presumed severe acute respiratory syndrome

               analyses of data from international rheumatology and

               METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
               multicentre, phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals or
               medical clinics to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and
               immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Adults (age $\geq$18
               years) who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions
               (not an immunocompromising condition or requiring treatment with
               immunosuppressive therapy) were randomised 1:1 with a
               computer-generated randomisation scheme (stratified for the
               presence or absence of chronic conditions) to receive two
               intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered 4 weeks

               study-related personnel, the sponsor, and nurses who
               administered the vaccines were masked to treatment group
               allocation; an unmasked contract research organisation and a
               masked expert adjudication panel assessed outcomes. The primary
               outcome was the efficacy of the BBV152 vaccine in preventing a
               first occurrence of laboratory-confirmed (RT-PCR-positive)
               symptomatic COVID-19 (any severity), occurring at least 14 days
               after the second dose in the per-protocol population. We also
               assessed safety and reactogenicity throughout the duration of
               the study in all participants who had received at least one dose
               of vaccine or placebo. This report contains interim results

               (active, not recruiting). FINDINGS: Between Nov 16, 2020, and
               Jan 7, 2021, we recruited 25 798 participants who were randomly
               assigned to receive BBV152 or placebo; 24 419 received two doses
               of BBV152 (n=12 221) or placebo (n=12 198). Efficacy analysis
               was dependent on having 130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19, which
               occurred when 16 973 initially seronegative participants had at
               least 14 days follow-up after the second dose. 24 (0·3\%) cases
               occurred among 8471 vaccine recipients and 106 (1·2\%) among
               8502 placebo recipients, giving an overall estimated vaccine
               efficacy of 77·8\% (95\% CI 65·2-86·4). In the safety population
               (n=25 753), 5959 adverse events occurred in 3194 participants.
               BBV152 was well tolerated; the same proportion of participants
               reported adverse events in the vaccine group (1597 [12·4\%] of
               12 879) and placebo group (1597 [12·4\%] of 12 874), with no
               clinically significant differences in the distributions of
               solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events between the
               groups, and no cases of anaphylaxis or vaccine-related deaths.
               INTERPRETATION: BBV152 was highly efficacious against
               laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease in adults.

               against different virus variants. However, host demographic or
               clinical characteristics that predict variability in
               cross-reactive antibody levels are not well-described. These
               data could inform clinicians, researchers, and policy makers on

               METHODS: In an institutional review board-approved prospective
               observational cohort study of staff at St. Jude Children's
               Research Hospital, we identified participants with plasma
               samples collected after SARS-CoV-2 infection, after mRNA
               vaccination, and after vaccination following infection, and
               quantitated IgG levels by ELISA to the spike receptor binding
               domain (RBD) from five important SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan
               Hu-1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.617.2). We used regression
               models to identify factors that contributed to cross-reactive
               IgG against one or multiple viral variants. RESULTS: Following
               infection, a minority of the cohort generated cross-reactive
               antibodies, IgG antibodies that bound all tested variants. Those
               that did had increased disease severity, poor metabolic health,

  abstract = "Background: In the setting of the current pandemic, concerns have
              arisen regarding the multisystemic involvement of sarcoidosis and
              the possible exacerbations in response to the exposure to severe
              acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Aim: This study aims to
              compare the differences in clinical presentation, management, and
              outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between patients
              with sarcoidosis and those in the general population. Methods: A
              literature search was conducted by reviewing original research
              articles such as case reports, case series, observational
              studies, and questionnaire-based surveys published in
              PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Google scholar. Data from
              individual patients in case series and case reports have been
              pooled to create a data set that was compared with larger such
              cohorts obtained from several other observational studies.
              Results: Twenty-seven patients were identified from 14 original
              articles. No significant differences were found in the clinical
              manifestations of patients with sarcoidosis presenting with
              COVID-19 as compared to the general population. The rate of
              hospitalization in our study was found to be 48.1\%. The overall
              mortality in our study was 7.4\%, which is higher than the global
              average of 2.1\%. Conclusion: Our observations have reinforced
              the hypothesis that the presence of additional medical
              comorbidities is associated with a higher risk of intensive care
              unit admission. Furthermore, the presence of moderate to a severe
              limitation in pulmonary functions is an additional risk factor
              associated with increased hospital admissions and mortality in
              sarcoidosis. However, neither the diagnosis of sarcoidosis nor
              ongoing treatment with steroids, methotrexate, or other
              immunosuppressants was associated with a poorer prognosis in
              patients with sarcoidosis. Relevance for patients: Patients with
              sarcoidosis must take added precautions to mitigate the risk of
              acquiring COVID-19 infection in view of the COVID-19-related

               Consequently, the World Health Organization's declaration of a
               global pandemic uniquely impacted those with IBD. Crohn's and
               Colitis Canada (CCC) formed the COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce to
               provide evidence-based guidance during the pandemic to
               individuals with IBD and their families. The Taskforce met
               regularly through the course of the pandemic, synthesizing
               available information on the impact of COVID-19 on IBD. At
               first, the information was extrapolated from expert consensus
               guidelines, but eventually, recommendations were adapted for an
               international registry of worldwide cases of COVID-19 in people
               with IBD. The task force launched a knowledge translation
               initiative consisting of a webinar series and online resources
               to communicate information directly to the IBD community.
               Taskforce recommendations were posted to CCC's website and
               included guidance such as risk stratification, management of
               immunosuppressant medications, physical distancing, and mental
               health. A weekly webinar series communicated critical
               information directly to the IBD community. During the pandemic,
               traffic to CCC's website increased with 484,755 unique views of
               the COVID-19 webpages and 126,187 views of the 23 webinars,
               including their video clips. CCC's COVID-19 and IBD Taskforce

               emerged, the nation underwent a lockdown, the economy reopened,
               and the second wave ensued. By integrating public health
               guidance through the unique prism of a vulnerable population,

               taken from patients in the first wave of COVID-19 infection in
               the South West of the UK. METHODS: We measured subgenomic RNA
               (sgRNA) and E gene genomic sequences in a retrospective
               collection of 176 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals,
               and related these to disease severity. We then assessed viral
               clearance dynamics in relation to symptom onset and last
               positive test. RESULTS: Whilst E-gene sgRNAs declined before
               E-gene genomic sequences, some individuals retained sgRNA
               positivity for up to 68 days. 13\% of sgRNA positive cases still
               exhibited clinically-relevant levels of virus after 10 days,
               with no clinical features previously associated with prolonged
               viral clearance times. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
               potentially active virus may sometimes persist beyond a 10 day
               period, and could pose a potential risk of onward transmission.
               Where this would pose a serious public health threat, additional

               multiple levels with the different components of the immune
               system and exert their activity against infections. Passive
               immunotherapy includes convalescent plasma from subjects who
               have recovered from infection, hyperimmune globulin formulations
               with a high titer of neutralizing antibodies, and monoclonal
               antibodies (mAbs). IVIG are used for the prevention and
               treatment of several infections, especially in immunocompromised
               patients, or in case of a poorly responsive immune system. The
               evolution of IVIG from a source of passive immunity to a
               powerful immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory agent results in
               extensive applications in autoimmune diseases. IVIG composition

               nationwide stay-at-home orders in an effort to slow the spread
               severely impacting the healthcare sector. Telepsychiatry
               provides a platform bridging the gap through advanced
               technologies connecting mental health providers and patients who
               need their services, overcoming previous barriers of great
               distances, lack of transportation, and even time constraints.
               The most obvious benefit is increased accessibility to mental
               healthcare, especially in underserved and remote areas where
               there is no easy access for in-person care. It is important to
               note that benefits are not limited to patients, but also allow
               clinicians greater flexibility in scheduling and reduced
               practice overhead costs, both of which aid with physician
               burnout and burden. Telepsychiatry during COVID-19 provides its
               own unique advantages over in-person visits. The risk of
               exposure to healthcare workers and patients receiving care is
               reduced, allowing immunocompromised patients to receive
               much-needed psychiatric care. Without the need to meet in
               person, self-isolating psychiatrists can still provide care,
               decreasing strain on their co-workers. Although telepsychiatry
               is relatively new, it has already exhibited considerable success
               in its effectiveness at treating psychiatric conditions and
               widespread corollary benefits. Telepsychiatric consults may be
               carried out synchronously and asynchronously, each having
               benefits and setbacks. Different mobile application
               interventions have been explored, which are available for the
               purpose of both monitoring/assessing patients and/or providing
               treatment. The scope of conditions these applications address is
               broad, from anxiety disorders to schizophrenia to depression. As
               promising and beneficial telepsychiatry may seem, it is
               necessary to recognize that building the program can be
               challenging. It involves adapting to new methods in medicine. We
               highlighted barriers to general telepsychiatry, the most
               prominent being technological literacy of both physician and

               Additional underlying medical conditions were reported for all
               but one patient, five were immunocompromised because of
               malignancy or organ transplantation, three were diabetic. Eleven
               patients developed pneumonia. Mortality was 53.8\% with a median
               time from diagnosis of mucormycosis to death of 9 days (range
               0-214 days) despite treatment with liposomal amphotericin B
               and/or isavuconazole in 10 of 13 cases. CAM prevalence amongst
               hospitalised COVID-19 patients overall (0.67\% and 0.58\% in two
               centres) and those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)
               (1.47\%, 1.78\% and 0.15\% in three centres) was significantly
               higher compared to non-COVID-19 patients (P < .001 for
               respective comparisons). CONCLUSION: COVID-19-associated
               mucormycosis is rare in Germany, mostly reported in patients
               with comorbidities and impaired immune system and severe
               COVID-19 treated in the ICU with high mortality compared to
               mainly rhino-orbito-cerebral CAM in patients with mild COVID-19
               in India. Risk for CAM is higher in hospitalised COVID-19
               patients than in other patients.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Haematological cancer patients are particularly
               vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. In addition to being
               immunocompromised, pandemic-related travel restrictions have
               impacted access to treatments and overseas stem cell donations
               for patients requiring transplantation. Given this
               vulnerability, people with haematological cancers are at risk of
               experiencing heightened distress during the pandemic. This study
               aimed to explore haematological cancer patients' experiences and
               needs. METHODS: Twenty-four Australian haematological cancer
               patients completed semi-structured interviews exploring their
               concerns and worries during the pandemic, impact of pandemic on
               management of disease, access to information and support,
               lifestyle changes, and attitudes towards emerging models of
               healthcare during the pandemic. Interview transcripts were
               thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes reflecting the
               experiences of haematological cancer patients during the
               pandemic were identified: 'Fears about contracting COVID-19'
               (behaviour changes to protect health, impact on daily routine
               and habits, annoyance at dismissive attitude of others toward
               COVID-19); 'Reduced sense of connection and support' (reduced
               social support and access to external support services); 'New
               challenges' (increased financial hardship, worsened health),
               and; 'Underlying system and communication issues' (access to
               trusted information, satisfaction/dissatisfaction with care,
               navigating telehealth). Participants expressed a need for
               improved access to support services and trusted information.
               CONCLUSIONS: The findings emphasise the additional challenges
               experienced by haematological cancer patients during the
               COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on daily life. Results point
               to the importance of validation of increased distress during
               periods of uncertainty; reinforcing recommendations about
               high-quality sources of information; and facilitating access to
               support services when face-to-face care is limited.",

  abstract  = "Mucormycosis is an aggressive and potentially fatal invasive
               fungal infection. The most common form of mucormycosis is
               rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). While it is commonly
               seen in immunocompromised patients, it is also known to affect
               healthy individuals. The global disease burden of ROCM has
               increased significantly following the surge in cases during the
               COVID-19 pandemic. Endoscopic sinus debridement, systemic
               antifungal therapy, and control of the underlying
               immunosuppressive condition are essential for the management of
               ROCM. Orbital involvement, however, presents a challenge to
               clinicians. Intervention strategies that have been described to
               treat orbital disease include orbital exenteration, conservative
               orbital debridement with or without irrigation with amphotericin
               B and transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of amphotericin B
               (TRAMB). Currently, there is a lack of clarity regarding the
               indications and outcomes of TRAMB as a treatment modality. In
               this review, the drug formulations used, the complications, and
               outcomes of previously described cases that have used TRAMB in
               cases of ROCM are discussed. Favorable outcomes following TRAMB
               depend on appropriate patient selection and radiological
               evidence of the orbital burden of the disease. This review aims
               to familiarize clinicians with objective parameters for patient
               selection for TRAMB, namely the extent of the disease, the
               clinical features, and radiological findings; viz. the clinical
               interpretation of areas of contrast uptake and those of
               necrosis. TRAMB can be considered as a viable option in select
               cases of orbital mucormycosis where exenteration or debridement
               are not indicated, or when there is limited orbital disease.",

               available to quantify and track SARS-CoV-2 antigen burden in
               respiratory samples from different populations. METHODS: We
               developed the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay (MSAA) with
               smartphone readout, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.5 pg/mL
               (10.6 fmol/L) nucleocapsid (N) antigen or 4000 copies/mL
               inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. We
               developed a computer vision and machine learning-based automatic
               microbubble image classifier to accurately identify positives
               and negatives, and quantified and tracked antigen dynamics in
               ICU COVID inpatients and immunocompromised COVID patients.
               RESULTS: Compared to qualitative RT-PCR methods, the MSAA
               demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 97\% (95\%
               confidence interval (CI), 92-99\%) and a negative percent
               agreement (NPA) of 97\% (95\% CI, 94-100\%) in a clinical
               validation study with 372 residual clinical NP swabs. In
               immunocompetent individuals, the antigen positivity rate in
               swabs decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite
               persistent nucleic acid positivity. Antigen was detected for
               longer and variable periods of time in immunocompromised
               patients with hematologic malignancies. Total microbubble
               volume, a quantitative marker of antigen burden, correlated
               inversely with Ct values and days-after-symptom-onset. Viral
               sequence variations were detected in patients with long duration
               of high antigen burden. CONCLUSIONS: The MSAA enables sensitive
               and specific detection of acute infections, quantification and
               tracking of antigen burden, and may serve as a screening method
               in longitudinal studies to identify patients who are likely

               American Thoracic Society Core Curriculum. Molecular methods
               have revolutionized microbiology. We highlight the need to
               collect appropriate samples for detection of specific pathogens
               or for panels and understand the limitations of the assays.
               Considerable progress has been made in imaging modalities for
               detecting pediatric pulmonary infections. Specifically, lung
               ultrasound and lung magnetic resonance imaging are promising
               radiation-free diagnostic tools, with results comparable with
               their radiation-exposing counterparts, for the evaluation and
               management of pulmonary infections. Clinicians caring for
               children with pulmonary disease should ensure that patients at
               risk for nontuberculous mycobacteria disease are identified and
               receive appropriate nontuberculous mycobacteria screening,
               monitoring, and treatment. Children with coronavirus disease
               (COVID-19) typically present with mild symptoms, but some may
               develop severe disease. Treatment is mainly supportive care, and
               most patients make a full recovery. Anticipatory guidance and
               appropriate counseling from pediatricians on social distancing
               and diagnostic testing remain vital to curbing the pandemic. The
               pediatric immunocompromised patient is at risk for invasive and
               opportunistic pulmonary infections. Prompt recognition of
               predisposing risk factors, combined with knowledge of clinical
               characteristics of microbial pathogens, can assist in the

              antigen tests cannot quantitate and track antigen dynamics with
              high sensitivity and specificity in respiratory samples. Methods:
              We developed and validated an ultra-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antigen
              assay with smartphone readout using the Microbubbling Digital
              Assay previously developed by our group, which is a platform that
              enables highly sensitive detection and quantitation of protein
              biomarkers. A computer vision-based algorithm was developed for
              microbubble smartphone image recognition and quantitation. A
              machine learning-based classifier was developed to classify the
              smartphone images based on detected microbubbles. Using this
              assay, we tracked antigen dynamics in serial swab samples from
              COVID patients hospitalized in ICU and immunocompromised COVID
              patients. Results: The limit of detection (LOD) of the
              Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay was 0.5 pg/mL (10.6 fM)
              recombinant nucleocapsid (N) antigen or 4000 copies/mL
              inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs,
              comparable to many rRT-PCR methods. The assay had high analytical
              specificity towards SARS-CoV-2. Compared to EUA-approved rRT-PCR
              methods, the Microbubbling Antigen Assay demonstrated a positive
              percent agreement (PPA) of 97\% (95\% confidence interval (CI),
              92-99\%) in symptomatic individuals within 7 days of symptom
              onset and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results, and a
              negative percent agreement (NPA) of 97\% (95\% CI, 94-100\%) in
              symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with negative nucleic
              acid results. Antigen positivity rate in NP swabs gradually
              decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite
              persistent nucleic acid positivity of the same samples. The
              computer vision and machine learning-based automatic microbubble
              image classifier could accurately identify positives and
              negatives, based on microbubble counts and sizes. Total
              microbubble volume, a potential marker of antigen burden,
              correlated inversely with Ct values and days-after-symptom-onset.
              Antigen was detected for longer periods of time in
              immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies,
              compared to immunocompetent individuals. Simultaneous detectable
              antigens and nucleic acids may indicate the presence of
              replicating viruses in patients with persistent infections.
              Conclusions: The Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay enables
              sensitive and specific detection of acute infections, and
              quantitation and tracking of antigen dynamics in different
              patient populations at various stages of infection. With
              smartphone compatibility and automated image processing, the
              assay is well-positioned to be adapted for point-of-care
              diagnosis and to explore the clinical implications of antigen
              dynamics in future studies.",

               diabetics, immunocompromised, or those with coronavirus disease
               2019 (COVID-19). Gastrointestinal involvement is uncommon but
               often deadly. We report a case of gastrointestinal mucormycosis
               causing intestinal perforation in a non-diabetic, COVID-19
               negative, immunocompetent woman, associated with puerperal
               sepsis. A 22-year-old woman presented to our center on
               post-natal day five, following delivery with insertion of an
               intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD). She had complaints of
               breathlessness, fatigue, and giddiness. Examination revealed
               tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and bilateral pedal edema.
               Following appropriate investigations, she was diagnosed with
               puerperal sepsis with pre-renal acute kidney injury. Imaging was
               suggestive of retained products of conception, and she
               subsequently underwent dilation and evacuation (D\&E) on day
               eight of admission. Following brief symptomatic improvement, on
               day 10 of admission, she developed vomiting, abdominal
               distension, and pain, with obstipation. Erect X-ray showed air
               under the diaphragm, suggestive of perforation. She emergently
               underwent laparotomy with limited right hemicolectomy, ileostomy
               with mucous fistula. Intraoperative findings revealed a
               closed-loop obstruction involving terminal ileum, with two
               perforations. The biopsy report later revealed colonization of
               Mucor and hemorrhagic necrosis along the entire length of the
               resected specimen. She was started on amphotericin B, and after
               a slow recovery, was discharged. Gastrointestinal mucormycosis
               is rare and has a mortality rate of 94\%. It is usually seen in
               those with predisposing factors for mucormycosis. This is the
               first report of mucormycosis associated with puerperal sepsis.
               It is typically acquired via ingestion and may cause
               perforation, where mortality is further increased. Diagnosis can
               only be confirmed by histopathology demonstrating the
               characteristic morphology of Mucor. Treatment requires resection
               of necrotic tissues, intensive treatment with amphotericin B,
               and correction of predisposing factors. Our case highlights the
               need for a high degree of suspicion for mucormycosis in patients
               with intestinal perforation, even if immunocompetent, and its

               well known to what extent SARS-CoV-2 treatment with monoclonal
               antibodies could trigger the selection of immune escape viral
               variants. Methods: After identifying immunocompromised patients
               with viral rebound under treatment with bamlanivimab, we
               characterized the SARS-CoV-2-isolates by whole genome
               sequencing. Viral load measurements and sequence analysis were
               performed consecutively before and after bamlanivimab
               administration. Findings: After initial decrease of viral load,
               viral clearance was not achieved in five of six
               immunocompromised patients treated with bamlanivimab. Instead,
               viral replication increased again over the course of the
               following one to two weeks. In these five patients, the E484K
               substitution - known to confer immune escape - was detected at
               the time of viral rebound but not before bamlanivimab treatment.
               Interpretation: Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with bamlanivimab in
               immunocompromised patients results in the rapid development of
               immune escape variants in a significant proportion of cases.

               and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited at Jena
               University Hospital. Blood samples were taken before, after the

               85.2\% of the controls showed levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2
               antibodies above the cutoff of 33.8 BAU/ml (p=0.329) after the

               SARS-CoV-2 vaccination compared to healthy controls, which was
               not influenced by different immunosuppressive regimens.
               Associated with the vaccination, we could also detect a slight
               increase of the TNF production among SARS-CoV-2-reactive TH
               cells in HD and IBD patients. After the second dose of
               vaccination, in IBD patients a further increase of humoral
               immune response in all but one patient was observed.
               CONCLUSIONS: Already after the first dose of a SARS-CoV-2
               vaccination, cellular immune response in IBD patients is
               comparable to controls, indicating a similar efficacy. However,
               close monitoring of long-term immunity in these patients should
               be considered.",

               SARS-CoV-2 infection, some have severe complications including
               Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. Neuroblastoma
               patients may be at higher risk of severe infection as treatment
               requires immunocompromising chemotherapy and SARS-CoV-2 has
               demonstrated tropism for nervous cells. To date, there is no
               sufficient epidemiological data on neuroblastoma patients with
               SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we evaluated datasets of non-SARS-CoV-2
               infected neuroblastoma patients to assess for key genes involved
               with SARS-CoV-2 infection as possible neuroblastoma prognostic
               and infection biomarkers. We hypothesized that ACE2, CD147, PPIA
               and PPIB, which are associated with viral-cell entry, are
               potential biomarkers for poor prognosis neuroblastoma and
               SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have analysed three publicly available
               neuroblastoma gene expression datasets to understand the
               specific molecular susceptibilities that high-risk neuroblastoma
               patients have to the virus. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
               GSE49711 and GEO GSE62564 are the microarray and RNA-Seq data,
               respectively, from 498 neuroblastoma samples published as part
               of the Sequencing Quality Control initiative. TARGET, contains
               microarray data from 249 samples and is part of the
               Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective
               Treatments (TARGET) initiative. ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB were
               identified through their involvement in both SARS-CoV-2
               infection and cancer pathogenesis. In-depth statistical analysis
               using Kaplan-Meier, differential gene expression, and Cox
               multivariate regression analysis, demonstrated that
               overexpression of ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB is significantly
               associated with poor-prognosis neuroblastoma samples. These
               results were seen in the presence of amplified MYCN,
               unfavourable tumour histology and in patients older than 18
               months of age. Previously, we have shown that high levels of the
               nerve growth factor receptor NTRK1 together with low levels of
               the phosphatase PTPN6 and TP53 are associated with increased
               relapse-free survival of neuroblastoma patients. Interestingly,
               low levels of expression of ACE2, CD147, PPIA and PPIB are
               associated with this NTRK1-PTPN6-TP53 module, suggesting that
               low expression levels of these genes are associated with good
               prognosis. These findings have implications for clinical care
               and therapeutic treatment. The upregulation of ACE2, CD147, PPIA
               and PPIB in poor-prognosis neuroblastoma samples suggests that
               these patients may be at higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2
               infection. Importantly, our findings reveal ACE2, CD147, PPIA

               mortality rates. During the last years, this pathogen displayed
               multidrug resistance (MDR), mainly due to extensive antibiotic
               abuse and poor stewardship. MDR isolates are associated with
               medical history of long hospitalization stays, presence of
               catheters, and mechanical ventilation, while immunocompromised
               and severely ill hosts predispose to invasive infections.
               Next-generation sequencing techniques have revolutionized
               diagnosis of severe A. baumannii infections, contributing to

               and enzymatic modifications resulting in antibiotic

               Although this is commonly afflicting immunocompromised people
               managed through prolonged ICU care, epidemiological observations
               suggest that it is also associated with conditions like
               uncontrolled diabetes. Due to its invasive nature and systemic
               reach, MCR has high mortality warranting an early diagnosis and
               treatment. We present here a case of a non-COVID, diabetic
               patient having acute onset paranasal and periorbital swelling
               with headache suspected for rhino-orbito-cerebral MCR. The case
               was innovatively dealt with jalaneti (saline nasal irrigation)
               seeing a delay in the institution of definitive anti-fungal
               therapy. Six sittings of jalaneti in four days had been able to
               give near complete symptomatic relief in paranasal swelling and
               headache even before the endoscopic nasal debridement and
               anti-fungal therapy was initiated. Seeing the urgency of
               diagnosis and treatment in any suspected case of MCR, a simple
               and self-administrable procedure like jalaneti seems to have a
               high value for its possible role in reducing the sinus
               inflammation and reducing the disease intensity in order to find
               more time for the proper diagnosis and treatment initiation.
               Negligible cost of jalaneti, its easy administration, and
               minimal adversity potential are additional advantages for
               proposing jalaneti as a possible prophylaxis in MCR. More

               pandemic, transplant centers were challenged to meet the demand
               for new telemedicine strategies. The ability of lung transplant
               providers (LTP) to conduct face-to-face clinic visits for
               high-risk immunocompromised patients, such as lung transplant
               recipients (LTR), was limited. Through the implementation of
               comprehensive medication management visits, pharmacists were
               able to assist LTP in the transition to telemedicine. Methods: A
               retrospective chart review of telephone encounters from
               cardiothoracic (CT) transplant pharmacists at our center from
               March to September 2020 was completed. LTR scheduled for clinic
               visits with LTP were called prior to the visit by CT transplant
               pharmacists who conducted medication list reviews, adherence
               assessments, and medication access assistance. Clinical
               recommendations were communicated directly to the LTP and
               documented in patient electronic medical records. The primary
               outcome was the number of pharmacist-driven clinical
               interventions. Secondary endpoints included the clinical
               severity and value of service of each intervention, percentage
               of accepted recommendations, patient cost savings interventions,
               prevention of adverse events, and avoidance of inappropriate
               doses. Results: From March to September 2020, the CT transplant
               pharmacists conducted 385 virtual visits on 157 LTR with a
               median of 20 minutes spent per visit. There were 891 total
               interventions made by CT transplant pharmacists, including 778
               medication discrepancies identified. Over 60\% of encounters
               demonstrated some form of medication error and over 55\% of
               encounters exhibited value of pharmacy services. Conclusion:
               Implementation of CT transplant pharmacist telehealth visits has
               potential for increased patient access to pharmacy care and
               improved accuracy of medication lists. When focusing on the
               severity of errors and value of services, most demonstrated a
               level of significance. Further investigation is needed to

              Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient
              virologic response, but her course was complicated by
              recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome

              the mutation conferred a ∼6-fold increase in remdesivir IC50 but

               alternatives to intravenous (IV) formulations, particularly
               those that may be administered in a non-clinical setting. Among
               these alternative formulations are subcutaneous (SC) injections,
               which comprise an increasing share of commercialized and

              patients. Prior studies have established hematologic cancers as a
              risk factor associated with particularly poor outcomes from
              COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies have established a
              beneficial role for anti-COVID-19 interventions in this at-risk
              population. Convalescent plasma therapy may benefit
              immunocompromised individuals with COVID-19, including those with
              hematologic cancers. Objective: To evaluate the association of
              convalescent plasma treatment with 30-day mortality in
              hospitalized adults with hematologic cancers and COVID-19 from a
              multi-institutional cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants:
              This retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 and
              Cancer Consortium registry with propensity score matching
              evaluated patients with hematologic cancers who were hospitalized
              for COVID-19. Data were collected between March 17, 2020, and
              January 21, 2021. Exposures: Convalescent plasma treatment at any
              time during hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main
              outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards
              regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders was
              performed. Hazard ratios (HRs) are reported with 95\% CIs.
              Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on patients with
              severe COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilatory support
              and/or intensive care unit admission. Results: A total of 966
              individuals (mean [SD] age, 65 [15] years; 539 [55.8\%] male)
              were evaluated in this study; 143 convalescent plasma recipients
              were compared with 823 untreated control patients. After
              adjustment for potential confounding factors, convalescent plasma
              treatment was associated with improved 30-day mortality (HR,
              0.60; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.97). This association remained significant
              after propensity score matching (HR, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.92).
              Among the 338 patients admitted to the intensive care unit,
              mortality was significantly lower in convalescent plasma
              recipients compared with nonrecipients (HR for propensity
              score-matched comparison, 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.20-0.80). Among the
              227 patients who required mechanical ventilatory support,
              mortality was significantly lower in convalescent plasma
              recipients compared with nonrecipients (HR for propensity
              score-matched comparison, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.72). Conclusions
              and Relevance: The findings of this cohort study suggest a
              potential survival benefit in the administration of convalescent
              plasma to patients with hematologic cancers and COVID-19.",

               vaccines against emerging pathogens like {SARS-CoV-2}",
  author    = "Palma, Marco",
  abstract  = "The current epidemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
               coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is raising awareness of the need to
               act faster when dealing with new pathogens. Exposure to an
               emerging pathogen generates an antibody response that can be
               used for preventing and treating the infection. These antibodies
               might have a high specificity to a target, few side effects, and
               are useful in the absence of an effective vaccine for treating
               immunocompromised individuals. The approved antibodies against
               the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein of
               SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., regdanvimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, and
               casirivimab/imdevimab) have been selected from the antibody
               repertoire of B cells from convalescent patients using flow
               cytometry, next-generation sequencing, and phage display. This
               encourages use of these techniques especially phage display,
               because it does not require expensive types of equipment and can
               be performed on the lab bench, thereby making it suitable for
               labs with limited resources. Also, the antibodies in blood
               samples from convalescent patients can be used to screen
               pre-made peptide libraries to identify epitopes for vaccine
               development. Different types of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have
               been developed, including inactivated virus vaccines, mRNA-based
               vaccines, non-replicating vector vaccines, and protein subunits.
               mRNA vaccines have numerous advantages over existing vaccines,
               such as efficacy, ease of manufacture, safety, and
               cost-effectiveness. Additionally, epitope vaccination may
               constitute an attractive strategy to induce high levels of
               antibodies against a pathogen and phages might be used as
               immunogenic carriers of such peptides. This is a point worth
               considering further, as phage-based vaccines have been shown to
               be safe in clinical trials and phages are easy to produce and
               tolerate high temperatures. In conclusion, identification of the
               antibody repertoire of recovering patients, and the epitopes
               they recognize, should be an attractive alternative option for
               developing therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies and vaccines
               against emerging pathogens.",

               stemming from pandemic-related stressors and vulnerability
               factors. This cross-sectional study included HCWs (N ​= ​2,246

               Mountain West who voluntarily completed an online survey in
               April/May 2020. Respondents completed measures for traumatic
               stress symptoms, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and sleep.
               Logistic regressions stratified by professional role (clinical
               versus non-clinical) were specified to predict clinical
               screening cutoff (positive/negative) as a function of five
               pandemic-related stressors (immunocompromised self;
               immunocompromised household member; care provision to infected
               patients; clinical management role; positive cases). Results
               showed that more than half of HCWs surveyed (52.5\%) screened
               positive (above cutoff) for traumatic stress, depression, or
               anxiety, with ~20\% reporting problematic alcohol use, and
               variable insufficient sleep from ~10\% off shift to ~50\% on
               shift. Clinical employees with an immunocompromised household
               member had increased odds of screening positive for a mental
               health problem. Non-clinical HCWs who were immunocompromised
               were at elevated risk for screening positive a mental health
               problem. Being female, minority status, and younger increased
               odds for mental health problems. Implications include
               alleviating a portion of the mental health burden of HCWs
               involved in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by considering
               policies to protect immunocompromised HCWs and their families

  abstract = "Pandemic SARS CoV-2 has been undergoing rapid evolution during
              spread throughout the world resulting in the emergence of many
              Spike protein variants, some of which appear to either evade
              antibody neutralization, transmit more efficiently, or
              potentially exhibit increased virulence. This raises significant
              concerns regarding the long-term efficacy of protection elicited
              after primary infection and/or from vaccines derived from single
              virus Spike (S) genotypes, as well as the efficacy of anti-S
              monoclonal antibody based therapeutics. Here, we used fully human
              polyclonal human IgG (SAB-185), derived from hyperimmunization of
              transchromosomic bovines with DNA plasmids encoding the
              SARS-CoV-2 Wa-1 strain S protein or purified ectodomain of S
              protein, to examine the neutralizing capacity of SAB-185 in vitro
              and the protective efficacy of passive SAB-185 antibody (Ab)
              transfer in vivo . The Ab preparation was tested for
              neutralization against five variant SARS-CoV-2 strains: Munich
              (Spike D614G), UK (B.1.1.7), Brazil (P.1) and SA (B.1.3.5)
              variants, and a variant isolated from a chronically infected
              immunocompromised patient (Spike $\Delta$144-146). For the in
              vivo studies, we used a new human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic Syrian
              hamster model that exhibits lethality after SARS-Cov-2 challenge
              and the Munich, UK, SA and $\Delta$144-146 variants. SAB-185
              neutralized each of the SARS-CoV-2 strains equivalently on Vero
              E6 cells, however, a control convalescent human serum sample was
              less effective at neutralizing the SA variant. In the hamster
              model, prophylactic SAB-185 treatment protected the hamsters from
              fatal disease and minimized clinical signs of infection. These
              results suggest that SAB-185 may be an effective treatment for
              patients infected with SARS CoV-2 variants.",

               a major challenge in neurorehabilitation. However, a requirement
               of physical distancing to date compromises their achievement.
               While mostly associated to COVID-19, physical distancing is not
               only required in a pandemic scenario, but also advised for
               several clinical conditions (e.g. immunocompromised individuals)
               or forced for specific social contexts (e.g. people living in
               remote areas worldwide). All these contexts advocate for the
               implementation of alternative healthcare models. The objective
               of this perspective is to highlight the benefits of remote
               administration of rehabilitative treatment, namely
               telerehabilitation, in counteracting physical distancing
               barriers in neurorehabilitation. Sustaining boosters of
               treatment outcome, such as compliance, sustainability, as well
               as motivation, telerehabilitation may adapt to multiple
               neurological conditions, with the further advantage of a high
               potential for individualization to patient's or pathology's
               specificities. The effectiveness of telerehabilitation can be
               potentiated by several technologies available to date: virtual
               reality can recreate realistic environments in which patients
               may bodily operate, wearable sensors allow to quantitatively
               monitor the patient's performance, and signal processing may
               contribute to the prediction of long-term dynamics of patient
               recovery. Telerehabilitation might spark its advantages far
               beyond the mere limitation of physical distancing effects,
               mitigating criticalities of daily neurorehabilitative practice,
               and thus paving the way to the envision of mixed models of care,

               effectiveness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the impact of
               mAbs on the nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load and virus
               quasispecies of mAb-treated patients using single-molecule
               real-time sequencing. The mAbs used were: Bamlanivimab alone
               (four patients), Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (23 patients) and
               Casirivimab/Imdevimab (five patients). RESULTS: The NP
               SARS-CoV-2 viral load of mAb-treated patients decreased from 8.2
               log10 copies/mL before administration to 4.3 log10 copies/mL 7
               days after administration. Five immunocompromised patients given
               Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab were found to have mAb activity-reducing
               spike mutations. Two patients harboured SARS-CoV-2 variants with
               a Q493R spike mutation 7 days after administration, as did a
               third patient 14 days after administration. The fourth patient
               harboured a variant with a Q493K spike mutation 7 days
               post-treatment, and the fifth patient had a variant with a E484K
               spike mutation on day 21. The emergence of the spike mutation
               was accompanied by stabilization or rebound of the NP viral load
               in three of five patients. CONCLUSION: Two-mAb therapy can drive
               the selection of resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants in
               immunocompromised patients. Patients given mAbs should be
               closely monitored and measures to limit virus spread should be

               simple in vivo method to measure T-cell functionality after
               natural infection and in vaccinated individuals. METHODS:
               Twenty-five kidney-transplanted recipients were immunized with
               two doses of the mRNA-based Pfizer-BioNTech COVID19 vaccine
               three weeks apart. Cell-immune response (CIR) was evaluated ten
               weeks later using an in vivo DTH skin test and in vitro with an
               interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). Humoral Immune Response
               (HIR) was determined by the measurement of specific IgG anti-S1
               SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Ten weeks after the second dose of the
               vaccine, 23 out of 25 transplanted patients had a positive DTH
               skin test, while in vitro CIR was considered positive in 20
               patients. Unspecific stimulation was positive in all 25
               patients, showing no T-cell defect. Seven out of twenty-five

               positive in all immune-competent control patients. CONCLUSIONS:
               DTH is a useful, simple, and cheaper tool that can be used to
               assess cellular immune response, with an excellent correlation
               with the in vitro CIR. CIR assessment after vaccination in these

               including favipiravir and remdesivir for treating HCoV-NL63
               infection. We first successfully modelled the 3D structure of
               HCoV-NL63 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) based on the
               experimentally solved SARS-CoV-2 RdRp structure. Molecular
               docking indicated that favipiravir has similar binding
               affinities to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 RdRp with LibDock scores
               of 75 and 74, respectively. The LibDock scores of remdesivir to
               SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 were 135 and 151, suggesting that
               remdesivir may have a higher affinity to HCoV-NL63 compared to
               SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In cell culture models infected with HCoV-NL63,
               both favipiravir and remdesivir significantly inhibited viral
               replication and production of infectious viruses. Overall,
               remdesivir compared to favipiravir is more potent in inhibiting
               HCoV-NL63 in cell culture. Importantly, there is no evidence of
               resistance development upon long-term exposure to remdesivir.
               Furthermore, combining favipiravir or remdesivir with the
               clinically used antiviral cytokine interferon-alpha resulted in
               synergistic effects. These findings provided a proof-of-concept
               that anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, in particular remdesivir, have the

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Acute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS) is a rapidly
               progressive disease, whose delayed identification results in
               poor outcomes, especially in immunocompromised individuals. A
               surge in of AIFS in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, has lent
               additional morbidity and mortality to an already precarious
               clinical scenario. Early detection of AIFS in individuals who
               are symptomatic/ at risk can allow early therapy, enabling
               better patient outcomes. Our study aims to determine optimal
               soft-tissue markers on CT for the early detection of AIFS.
               METHODS: In this case-control study, 142 patients with equal
               distribution of subjects were chosen based on histopathological
               diagnosis of AIFS; and their non-contrast CT scans were
               retrospectively assessed to determine the diagnostic utility of
               specific soft-tissue markers that would enable diagnosis of
               AIFS. RESULTS: A total of 9 markers with adequate sensitivity
               and specificity were identified, including pterygopalatine and
               sphenopalatine fossae, inferior orbital fissure and nasolacrimal
               duct involvement, premaxillary thickening, retro-antral and
               orbital stranding, and infratemporal muscle edema. It was
               determined that the combined occurrence of any 3 out of 9
               markers was 91.5\% sensitive and 95.9\% specific for diagnosis
               of AIFS (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Early, accurate detection of
               AIFS in predisposed individuals is possible with identification
               of soft-tissue markers on NECT, enabling early intervention.
               ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Being the aggressive disease that it is,
               AIFS may be managed early if the index of suspicion is held high
               via CT imaging; which our diagnostic checklist aims at enabling.",

               significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. These viruses
               have been identified as important causative agents of acute
               respiratory disease in infants, the elderly, and
               immunocompromised individuals. Clinical signs of infection range
               from mild upper respiratory illness to more serious lower
               respiratory illness, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia.
               Additionally, these illnesses can have long-lasting impact on
               patient health well beyond resolution of the viral infection.
               Aside from influenza, there are currently no licensed vaccines
               against these viruses. However, several research groups have
               tested various vaccine candidates, including those that utilize
               attenuated virus, virus-like particles (VLPs), protein subunits,
               and nanoparticles, as well as recent RNA vaccines, with several

               reads, and confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia due to P.
               jirovecii and CMV. Following the patient's treatment with
               anti-PCP and anti-CMV, the patient was cured and discharged.
               Conclusions: This case highlights the combined application of
               NGS in the clinical diagnosis of multi-pathogenic pneumonia in
               an HIV-infected patient. NGS is proposed as an important

               determine whether hematooncological patients develop
               anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after vaccination. Design, Setting,
               and Participants: This retrospective cohort study included 2
               independent cohorts of patients who were treated for
               hematological and solid malignant tumors between October 2020
               and May 2021, comprising 901 samples from 595 patients and 58
               health care workers (HCWs). Serum samples were collected from
               patients who were treated at an academic center and a community
               hospital in a rural area and a control group of HCWs, all of
               whom received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Main Outcomes and
               Measures: Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (anti-NC) and
               antispike protein (anti-S) antibodies were measured
               retrospectively. Results: In total, 595 patients (320 women
               [53.8\%] and 275 men [46.2\%]; median [range] age, 67 [19-96]
               years) and 58 HCWs (40 women [69.0\%] and 18 men [31.0\%];
               median [range] age, 42 [24-60] years) were included. Previous
               SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented in 43 of 595 (7.2\%), while
               anti-NC antibodies that suggested previous infections were
               observed in 49 of 573 evaluable patients (8.6\%). In both
               cohorts, anti-S antibody levels were higher in fully vaccinated
               patients compared with patients who received 1 dose. After the
               first vaccination, patients with hematological cancer who
               received B cell-targeting agents had lower anti-S levels
               (median, 1.6 AU/mL; range: 0-17 244 AU/mL) than patients who
               received other therapies (median, 191.6 AU/mL; range, 0-40 000;
               P < .001) or patients with solid tumors (median, 246.4 AU/mL;
               range, 0-40 000 AU/mL; P < .001). Anti-S levels after the first
               vaccination differed according to ongoing antineoplastic
               treatment modalities, with the lowest median levels in patients
               who received chemotherapy alone (157.7 AU/mL; range, 0-40 000
               AU/mL) or in combination with immunotherapy (118.7 AU/mL; range,
               14.1-38 727 AU/mL) and the highest levels in patients with no
               ongoing antineoplastic treatment (median, 634.3 AU/mL; range,
               0-40 000 AU/mL; P = .01). Antibody levels after full
               immunization were higher in HCWs (median, 2500 U/mL; range,
               485-2500 U/mL) than in patients with cancer (median, 117.0 U/mL;
               range, 0-2500 U/mL; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In
               this cohort study of patients with hematooncological diseases
               and a control group of HCWs, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after
               vaccination could be detected in patients with cancer. Lower

               the unique criterion used, in addition to symptom cessation.
               This study evaluates the role of the Lumipulse\textregistered{}
               Antigen Assay (LAA) for the safe end of isolation of patients
               $\geq$21 days after the diagnosis of infection. METHODS: A total
               of 671 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients diagnosed with
               infection at least 21 days before were assessed by RT-PCR and
               LAA, and the role of LAA in predicting the absence of
               infectivity was evaluated by virus cell culture. RESULTS: Viable
               virus was present in 10/138 cultured samples. Eight out of ten
               infective patients suffered from a concomitant disease,
               predisposing them to long-term shedding of infective virus. In
               particular, infectious virus was isolated from 10/20
               RT-PCR+/LAA+ cultured samples, whereas no viable virus was found
               in all 118 RT-PCR+/LAA- cultured swabs. LLA and RT-PCR agreed in
               484/671 (72.1\%) samples, with 100\% and 26.7\% concordance in
               RT-PCR negative and positive samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
               Viable virus can be found $\geq$21 days after diagnosis in
               immunocompromised or severely ill patients. LAA better than
               RT-PCR predicts non-infectivity of patients and can be safely

               additional challenges to the health care system induced by novel

               prepared and characterized four novel organometallic derivatives

               importantly, enzyme inhibition and chemogenomic profiling
               demonstrated that lanosterol 14$\alpha$-demethylase, as for
               fluconazole, was the main target of the most active compound of

               suggested that 2a induced a loss in cell wall integrity as well
               as intracellular features ascribable to late apoptosis or

               towards azole-resistant strains. This finding is very
               interesting since the primary target of 2a is the same as that
               of fluconazole, emphasizing the role played by the
               organometallic moiety. In vivo experiments in a mice model of
               Candida infections revealed that 2a reduced the fungal growth
               and dissemination but also ameliorated immunopathology, a
               finding suggesting that 2a is active in vivo with added activity

               The ZIKV emerged as a major human pathogen due to its
               association with the impairment of perinatal development and
               Guillain-Barr{\'e} syndrome. The occurrence of these severe
               cases of Zika points to the significance of studies for
               understanding the molecular determinants of flavivirus
               pathogenesis. Reverse genetics is a powerful method for studying
               the replication and determinants of pathogenesis, virulence, and
               viral attenuation of flaviviruses, facilitating the design of
               vaccines and therapeutics. However, the main hurdle in the
               development of infectious clones is the instability of
               full-length cDNA in Escherichia coli. Here, we described the
               development of a genetically stable and efficient infectious
               clone based on the ZIKV Rio-U1 isolated in the 2016 epidemic in
               Brazil. The employed strategy consisted of cloning the viral
               cDNA genome into two stable plasmid subclones and obtaining a
               high-quality cDNA template with increment in DNA mass for in
               vitro transcription by PCR amplification. The strategy for
               developing a ZIKV infectious cDNA clone designed in this study
               was successful, yielding a replicative and efficient
               clone-derived virus with high similarities with its parental
               virus, Rio-U1, by comparison of the proliferation capacity in
               mammal and insect cells. The infection of AG129
               immunocompromised mice caused identical mortality rates, with
               similar disease progression and morbidity in the animals
               infected with the parental and the cDNA-derived virus.
               Histopathological analyses of mouse brains infected with the
               parental and the cDNA-derived viruses revealed a similar
               pathogenesis degree. We observed meningoencephalitis, cellular
               pyknosis, and neutrophilic invasion adjacent to the choroid
               plexus and perivascular cuffs with the presence of neutrophils.
               The developed infectious clone will be a tool for genetic and

               traditionally discouraged, yet in times of heightened medical
               applications such as the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, it can be
               difficult to obtain. In this article we examine the reuse of
               disposable gowns with respect to still providing personnel
               protection. XR7, a fluorescent powder, was used to track
               contamination of gowns after manipulation of rodent cages. Mouse
               cages were treated with XR7 prior to manipulations. Disposable
               gowns were labeled for single person use and hung in common
               procedure spaces within the vivarium between usages. A simulated
               rack change of 140 cages was completed using XR7-treated cages.
               One individual changed all cages with a break occurring after
               the first 70 cages, requiring the gown to be removed and reused
               once. To simulate research activities, 5 individuals accessed 3
               XR7-treated cages daily for 5 d. Each mouse in the XR7-treated
               cages was manipulated at least once before returning cages to
               the housing room. Disposable gowns were reused 5 times per
               individual. Gowns, gloves, clothing, bare arms, and hands were
               scanned for fluorescence before and after removing PPE.
               Fluorescence was localized to gloves and gown sleeves in closest
               contact with animals and caging. No fluorescence was detected on
               underlying clothing, or bare arms and hands after removing PPE.
               Fluorescence was not detected in procedure spaces where gowns
               were hung. The lack of fluorescence on personnel or surfaces
               indicate that gowns can be reused 1 time for routine husbandry
               tasks and up to 5 times for research personnel. A method for
               decontamination of used gowns using Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide
               (VHP) was also validated for use in areas where animals are
               considered high risk such as quarantine, or for fragile

               phenomena that represent neuropsychiatric disorders and can be
               triggered by an exacerbated immune response against pathogens,
               brain injury, or autoimmune diseases. Pro-inflammatory
               molecules, such as cytokines and chemokines, are produced in the
               brain by resident cells, mainly by microglia and astrocytes.
               Brain infiltrating immune cells constitutes another source of
               these molecules, contributing to an impaired neurological
               synapse function, affecting typical neurobehavioral and

               supporting the notion that behavioral alterations and cognitive
               impairment can be associated with respiratory viral infections,
               such as human respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and

               one dose of ChAdOx1-S-nCoV-19 receive a second dose of the

               and the immunogenicity of this vaccination regimen have not been
               formally tested. Here we show that the heterologous
               ChAdOx1-S-nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 combination confers better
               protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

               healthcare workers (n = 13,121). To understand the underlying
               mechanism, we conducted a longitudinal survey of the anti-spike
               immunity conferred by each vaccine combination. Both
               combinations induced strong anti-spike antibody responses, but
               sera from heterologous vaccinated individuals displayed a
               stronger neutralizing activity regardless of the SARS-CoV-2
               variant. This enhanced neutralizing potential correlated with
               increased frequencies of switched and activated memory B cells
               that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. The
               ChAdOx1-S-nCoV-19 vaccine induced a weaker IgG response but a
               stronger T cell response than the BNT162b2 vaccine after the
               priming dose, which could explain the complementarity of both
               vaccines when used in combination. The heterologous vaccination
               regimen could therefore be particularly suitable for

               birds and horses in central Europe, with a first mosquito-borne
               autochthonous human infection detected in Germany in 2019. Human
               infections are typically asymptomatic, with occasional severe
               neurological disease. Because of a low number of cases in
               central Europe, awareness regarding potential cases is low and
               WNV diagnostic is neglected. We tested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
               samples from unsolved encephalitis and meningitis cases from
               Berlin from 2019 and 2020, and describe a WNV-encephalitis case
               in a 33-year old kidney transplant recipient. The infectious
               course was resolved by serology, RT-PCR, and sequencing of
               stored samples. Phylogenetic sequence analysis revealed a close
               relationship of the patient's WNV strain to German sequences
               from 2019 and 2020. A lack of travel history and patient

              post-CAR-T-cell therapy were in remission. We tested for
              antibodies to 4 vaccine strains at baseline and $\geq$1 time
              point after IIV using neutralization and hemagglutination

              responses to $\geq$1 vaccine strain occurred in 2 (29\%)
              individuals before CAR-T-cell therapy; one individual maintained

              Across all tested vaccine strains, seroprotection was less
